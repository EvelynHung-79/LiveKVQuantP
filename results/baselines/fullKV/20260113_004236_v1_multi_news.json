            "output": "**Occupy Protests Continue Across the Country**\n\nThe Occupy Wall Street movement, which began two months ago, continues to gain momentum and attention across the United States. In recent days, protests have taken place in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other cities, with demonstrators calling for economic justice and an end to corporate greed.\n\n**Philadelphia**\n\nIn Philadelphia, about 100 Occupy Philly protesters remained on site at City Hall into the evening of November 28, despite a deadline set by Mayor Nutter for them to leave. Police had no plans to evict anyone, and Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan praised the protesters for their nonviolent behavior. However, the city has said it needs to erect fencing this week for work at Dilworth Plaza, including renovation of the SEPTA tunnels and the addition of grass, a cafe, stage, and winter ice rink. Many protesters have begun to take down their tents, but some remain, including Darrin Annussek, an unemployed career counselor, and William Tuttle, a student, who said they would move to the Occupy site in Washington.\n\n**Los Angeles**\n\nIn Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered Occupy L.A. protesters to immediately disperse or face arrest. However, police did not clear the park, and protesters remained on site. The Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks, is among the largest on the West Coast and has grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, with at least a third of campers believed to be homeless. Police commanders said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak, and it is \"highly unlikely\" that the camp will be forced to shut down on Monday.\n\n**Nationwide Protests**\n\nElsewhere in the country, a 5 p.m. Sunday deadline set by Philadelphia officials for Occupy protesters to move from a similar encampment came and went without incident. Dozens of people heeded the order, but many tents and other structures stayed put. Police sources said authorities were hoping the rest of the protesters would relocate voluntarily and that no major actions were expected before Tuesday.\n\n**Reactions from Leaders**\n\nMayor Nutter of Philadelphia has been praised for his handling of the situation, with Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan saying that the police reaction to Occupy Philadelphia has been different from other cities. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles has also been relatively accommodating to the Occupy group, but after the collapse of negotiations aimed at persuading protesters",
            "ground_truth": "The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\"",

In a letter written to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov expressed his deep-seated guilt over the countless lives lost due to his invention. The letter, dated May 2012, revealed a man grappling with the moral implications of his creation.\n\nKalashnikov's journey began during World War II, when he was wounded fighting for the Red Army. He designed the AK-47 to address the dire lack of weapons within the Soviet military. The rifle's simplicity and durability made it a staple in many countries, with over 100 million units sold worldwide. However, its widespread use also led to its association with terrorism, child soldiers, and countless deaths.\n\nIn his letter, Kalashnikov questioned whether he was responsible for the lives lost due to his invention. He wrote, \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" This admission marked a significant departure from his previous stance, where he blamed the policies of other countries for the rifle's misuse.\n\nKalashnikov's conversion to Christianity at the age of 91, followed by his baptism, suggests a late-in-life search for spiritual redemption. His letter to Patriarch Kirill was met with a response from the Church, which emphasized its support for those who create weapons to protect their country.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church's stance on the matter is clear: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both their creators and the soldiers who use them. This position is reflected in the words of Patriarch Kirill's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, who stated, \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nKalashnikov's legacy serves as a reminder of the complex consequences of innovation and the importance of considering the moral implications of our creations. As the world continues to grapple with the impact of the AK-47, Kalashnikov's story serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of war and the need for accountability.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* 1996: Alexa Internet begins donating crawl data",

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter.",

The suspect, 23-year-old Paul Ciancia, was shot by airport police officers four times and taken into custody.\n\nAccording to law enforcement officials, paramedics waited 150 yards away from Hernandez, who was bleeding, because police had not declared the terminal safe to enter. It took 33 minutes for Hernandez to be wheeled out by police to an ambulance, during which time there was no threat from the gunman. Hernandez died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, despite efforts by doctors to revive him.\n\nThe investigation into the shooting is ongoing, with officials examining conversations between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter the terminal and whether paramedics could have gone in earlier. TSA workers at LAX have expressed concerns about a lack of coordination between entities at the airport, which may have led to the delay in treatment for Hernandez and other victims.\n\nCiancia, who remains in fair condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, is charged with killing Hernandez and wounding three others, including two other TSA officers. The charges carry a potential death sentence. In a separate development, hundreds of people attended a public memorial service honoring Hernandez, the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the response to active shooter situations, with some officials suggesting that police and firefighters may not be adequately trained to respond to such incidents. A recent audit by the Los Angeles Police Commission Inspector General found that the LAPD had a zero percent compliance rate in providing first aid and CPR training to officers, while airport police have the training.\n\nThe investigation into the shooting is ongoing, with officials working to determine the circumstances surrounding the delay in treatment for Hernandez and other victims.",

Now under review: the conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter, and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier. While an officer who checked on Hernandez about 5 minutes after he was shot told numerous officers he was dead, the AP reports that it's not known whether that officer had the training needed to make that determination; no first-aid was administered. \"I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,\" an LAX employee says. \"We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.\" The results of the investigation could be months away, the AP adds.

The meeting, which lasted for two hours, was described as \"friendly and open\" by Ashton, who said that Morsi was in good condition and had access to newspapers and television.\n\nAshton's visit to Egypt comes at a time of heightened tensions between the military-backed interim government and Morsi's supporters, who have been protesting in the streets for weeks. The protests have resulted in the deaths of at least 80 people, and Morsi is currently under investigation for allegations of espionage and murder.\n\nAshton's meeting with Morsi was seen as a significant step towards finding a political solution to the crisis, and the EU diplomat said that she hoped the meetings would facilitate conversations that might lead to a resolution. However, Morsi's supporters have made it clear that they will not stop protesting until the president is restored to power and the country's Islamist-dominated parliament and constitution are reinstated.\n\nThe meeting between Ashton and Morsi was also seen as a test of the military's willingness to work with the ousted president towards a political solution. While Ashton declined to go into detail about the substance of her conversation with Morsi, she said that he was \"well\" and that they had a \"friendly and open\" discussion.\n\nAshton's visit to Egypt also included meetings with a wide range of Egyptian political figures, including Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, the commander of the armed forces, and representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood. The EU diplomat stressed that the people of Egypt will determine their own future, and that the EU is there to help, but not to impose a solution.\n\nThe US has also weighed in on the crisis, with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel speaking by telephone with Sissi and urging \"restraint\" in dealing with protesters. The US has called for an \"inclusive reconciliation process\" to resolve the crisis.\n\nOverall, Ashton's meeting with Morsi marks a significant development in the ongoing crisis in Egypt, and highlights the EU's efforts to find a political solution to the country's problems.

The pair had a \"very long and in-depth conversation,\" Ashton says. Ashton, who has met with several other Egyptian political figures while in the country, says she wasn't there to help Morsi break out, but rather to facilitate discussions toward a peaceful end to the country's political unrest, the Washington Post reports. \"First of all, we are here to help. We are not here to impose,\" she says. \"The people of Egypt will determine their own future.\" But will Morsi play ball? \"He's a very proud man,\" says a source close to the former leader, per the Journal. \"I think the idea of doing anything on (the) army's terms will not work with him.\"",

This move is seen as a precautionary measure, with Pentagon officials stating that it does not reflect any specific orders from Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian government has called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to allow United Nations investigators to access the site of the attack. However, American and foreign diplomats believe that this move does not indicate a shift in Russia's support for Assad or its resistance to punitive measures in the Security Council.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry has placed the blame on Syria's opposition forces, suggesting that the attack was a provocation by the rebels.

If Pao decides to pursue an appeal, the case would be heard by California's First District Court of Appeal, which has a history of affirming employment decisions in favor of employers.\n\nThe case has sparked a wider discussion about gender diversity in the tech industry, with many experts and advocates calling for greater efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. Kleiner Perkins has stated that it believes women in technology would be best served by focusing on making progress on issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation.\n\nIn a surprising move, Kleiner Perkins has offered Pao a deal: if she agrees not to pursue an appeal, the firm will forgive its costs.

The case, which went unsolved for half a century, was one of the oldest cold cases in the United States.\n\nMaria Ridulph was abducted on December 3, 1957, while playing in the snow with a friend in Sycamore, Illinois. Her body was found five months later, and despite a massive investigation by the FBI, no one was ever charged in connection with her murder.\n\nIn 2012, McCullough was convicted of the crime and sentenced to life in prison. However, a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack raised questions about the conviction. Schmack concluded that McCullough could not have killed Maria, citing newly discovered phone records that supported McCullough's long-held alibi.\n\nAccording to Schmack, the phone records showed that McCullough made a collect call to his parents at 6:57 p.m. from a phone booth in downtown Rockford, which is 40 miles northwest of where Maria was abducted. This evidence, combined with other documents and police reports, led Schmack to conclude that McCullough was innocent.\n\nOn Friday, Judge William P. Brady ordered McCullough's release from prison, citing the new evidence and Schmack's review of the case. McCullough was seen smiling and hugging family members after the hearing, while Maria's brother and sister displayed little emotion.\n\nThe case has raised questions about the reliability of eyewitness testimony and the use of circumstantial evidence in convictions. Maria's family remains convinced that McCullough is guilty and has sought the appointment of a special prosecutor to keep him behind bars.\n\nThe release of McCullough has brought closure to some, but also reopened old wounds in the community of Sycamore, where Maria's murder had a profound impact on the town. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that justice is served, and that the rights of the accused are protected.\n\n**Timeline of the Case:**\n\n* December 3, 1957: Maria Ridulph is abducted while playing in the snow with a friend in Sycamore, Illinois.\n* 1958: Maria's",

According to CBS News, 76-year-old Jack McCullough was convicted of kidnapping a 7-year-old girl, choking her, and stabbing her to death in 1957. The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports. McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened. But his was the only non-yearbook photo in the lineup, and she picked a different man out of a photo lineup 50 years earlier. That info wasn't allowed at McCullough's trial either. No physical evidence was ever found to support McCullough's conviction.",

Gianforte was sentenced to a 180-day deferred sentence, 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, and a $300 fine. He has apologized to the journalist and pledged to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\n**President Trump's Comments on Gianforte's Incident**\n\nPresident Trump has come under fire for making light of Gianforte's physical assault on a reporter at a Montana rally. Trump praised Gianforte, saying, \"Any guy that can do a body slam, he is my type!\" The White House Correspondents' Association has condemned the president's comments, calling them a celebration of a violent act targeting a free and independent news media.\n\n**Montana Senate Race**\n\nThe Montana Senate race is heating up, with President Trump visiting the state to campaign for Republican candidate Matt Rosendale. Trump has made it his mission to unseat Democratic Senator Jon Tester, who has a bipartisan record in the Senate. Tester has touted his ability to work with the president, even publishing a full-page newspaper ad thanking Trump for signing 16 of his bills into law.\n\n**Midterm Elections**\n\nThe midterm elections are shaping up to be a contentious battle, with President Trump emphasizing issues such as immigration, law and order, and common sense. Trump has falsely claimed that Democrats are supporting a caravan of immigrants traveling up from Central America, and has vowed to send the military to defend the Southern border if necessary.\n\n**Social Media and Location Information**\n\nTwitter has announced that users can add location information to their tweets, including their city or precise location.

Greg Gianforte, who assaulted Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs last year during the special election for the House seat vacated by Ryan Zinke, a misdemeanor assault to which he pleaded guilty and completed community service and an anger management class. Trump said after the incident, he feared Gianforte had blown his chance at the congressional seat. \"I said, 'Oh, this is terrible, he's gonna lose the election,'\" Trump recounted. \"Then I said, 'Well, wait a minute—I know Montana pretty well. I think it might help him.' And it did.\" Trump was in Big Sky Country stumping for Matt Rosendale in his race for Democrat Jon Tester's Senate seat. Reaction came quickly: John Mulholland, US editor of the Guardian, put out a statement after the rally blasting Trump's words as \"an attack on the First Amendment,\" asking for an apology and adding, \"In the aftermath of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, it runs the risk of inviting other assaults on journalists both here and across the world.\" ABC News reports on what the Toronto Star's Daniel Dale calls the \"most significant\" and \"truly horrible\" moment in the rally: \"The president is gleefully applauding violence against a journalist.\" Trump also praised Gianforte as \"smart\" and then advised the crowd to \"never wrestle him.\" (Trump seems to acknowledge Khashoggi is dead.)",

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and immune responses.\n\nAccording to the studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes harder to kill, with macrophages (immune cells) having a significantly harder time eliminating the bacteria. The smoke-exposed MRSA was found to be more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are common forms of immune defense. Moreover, the bacteria were able to adhere better to human cells, making it easier for them to invade and cause infections.\n\nThe studies, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, suggest that cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to immune responses. This effect was found to be dose-dependent, with higher levels of smoke extract leading to increased resistance.\n\nThe findings are alarming, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections, including pneumonia, skin infections, and bloodstream infections. The bacteria are often resistant to antibiotics, making treatment challenging. The studies suggest that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nThe research also found that e-cigarette vapor has a similar effect on MRSA, but to a lesser extent. However, the study on e-cigarette vapor was conducted a year earlier, and the current study focused on cigarette smoke.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant, as they suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also makes pathogens more aggressive and resistant to treatment. The studies highlight the need for individuals to refrain from smoking and for healthcare professionals to be aware of the potential risks associated with cigarette smoke exposure.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Cigarette smoke makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and immune responses.\n* MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes harder to kill, with macrophages having a significantly harder time eliminating the bacteria.\n* The smoke-exposed MRSA was found to be more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides.\n* The bacteria were able to adhere better to human cells, making it easier for them to invade and cause infections.\n* The effect of",
            "ground_truth": "Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough. But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia. (The latest antibiotic-resistant bug to make headlines is a nasty stomach virus.)",

The study used a combination of algorithms, including PageRank and CheiRank, to analyze the links between Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them.\n\nAccording to the study, the most influential person in the English-language world is Frank Sinatra, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study was expanded to include all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, the results were different. Adolf Hitler took the top spot, with Michael Jackson in second place and Madonna in third.\n\nThe study aimed to discover if Wikipedia was skewed in its attention to various figures, either by gender, time, or location. The results showed that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century and are male. However, each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so that most of its own historical figures are born in the countries that use the language of the edition.\n\nThe study also found that the algorithm used to determine importance was thrown off by a quirk of Wikipedia: the site contains an almost complete collection of named species, which are linked to Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist. To get around this issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance, CheiRank, which takes into account the number of outgoing links.\n\nWhen the researchers mixed PageRank and CheiRank together, they arrived at the final measure: 2DRank. This is how they arrived at the top 100 for all 24 editions of Wikipedia, with Frank Sinatra taking pole position.\n\nHowever, a separate study by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom, published in a different context, found that the world's most influential mind was actually Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. This result was surprising, as Linnaeus beat out everyone from the Pope to President Obama to Frank Sinatra, Hitler, Caesar, and even Jesus.\n\nAccording to the study, Linnaeus' particular scientific penchant, combined with the specifics of Young-Ho Eom's method of searching Wikipedia, led to the unexpected result. Linnaeus' system of naming species is still widely used today, and his work is linked to many Wikipedia pages, making him the most influential thinker in the world.\n\nIn a related effort, the",

Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been 32 new cases of AFM confirmed across the United States through July, a sharp rise compared to last year, when just seven cases had been confirmed by that month.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord. It is characterized by sudden onset of muscle weakness, often in the arms and legs, and can lead to respiratory failure. The exact cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections, including enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nSymptoms of AFM include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and respiratory failure. The condition is often diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and laboratory tests. However, there is no specific treatment for AFM, and most cases are treated with physical therapy and supportive care.\n\n**Outbreaks and Cases**\n\nThe CDC reported 50 cases of AFM across 24 states from January 1 to August 31, 2016, compared to 21 cases in 2015. In 2014, there were 120 cases reported between August and December, all of which were children. The average age of children affected by AFM is 7, and most have had to be placed on respirators.\n\n**Investigation and Prevention**\n\nThe CDC is investigating the current rise of AFM cases, and health officials are advising people to wash their hands with soap and water, avoid close contact with sick people, and clean surfaces with a disinfectant. The CDC is also collaborating with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM.

Within days in August 2014, she was \"a limp rag doll,\" reports Today—but it took doctors some time to diagnose her with acute flaccid myelitis, a rare disease the CDC warns is becoming increasingly more common. Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling. The CDC reports 121 cases of AFM were confirmed in 2014, but that was followed by just 21 cases in 2015, reports Fox News. From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully. A CDC study found 68% of patients had a fever and 81% had a respiratory illness before AFM symptoms appeared. Some had been diagnosed with the West Nile virus, and others with an enterovirus. \"August to October is typically when enteroviruses circulate\" and \"we see more acute flaccid myelitis during that season,\" a doctor tells NBC News.

Recently, a forensic investigation has shed new light on the shroud's authenticity, suggesting that it may be a medieval fake.\n\n**Bloodstain Pattern Analysis**\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli conducted a bloodstain pattern analysis on the shroud, using real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back.\n\n**Inconsistent Bloodstain Patterns**\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They discovered that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\n**Spear Wound and Lower Back Stain**\n\nThe researchers also found that the simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone. Additionally, they were unable to replicate the lower back stain, which appears as a \"blood belt\" on the shroud.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe findings of the forensic investigation suggest that the Shroud of Turin may be a medieval fake, created to depict a crucified man. The researchers concluded that the bloodstains on the shroud are inconsistent with any one pose, and that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. This raises questions about the shroud's authenticity and its connection to Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n**Previous Research**\n\nPrevious research on the shroud has yielded inconclusive results, including radiocarbon dating that suggests the shroud originated between 1260 and 1390. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe forensic investigation raises new questions about the Shroud of Turin and its authenticity.",
            "ground_truth": "The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man. But a new study reported in the Journal of Forensic Sciences finds the bloodstain image was likely faked. Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \"totally unrealistic\" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the Vatican; Fox News notes \"the church has never weighed in on its authenticity.\" \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" The study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains—a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

This is not the first time Ross has been accused of exaggerating his net worth, as he has been known to inflate his numbers to boost his business and social standing.\n\n**Ross' Business Career**\n\nRoss' business career has been marked by controversy and questionable ethics.

The discovery came when Ross, 79, contacted Forbes in October to refute his ranking: Last year he was listed with a net worth of $2.9 billion on the Forbes 400; he claimed he was worth closer to $3.7 billion. Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague.

She says Spacey stuck his hand down her son's pants and onto his genitals, and tried to convince him to go to a party where they could continue to drink, USA Today reports. A bystander asked the teen if he was OK and the teen said no, at which point the woman urged the teen to flee and he took her advice, Unruh said. Unruh, who appeared with an attorney, says her son filed a police report last week and handed over evidence; she says a criminal investigation has been opened but the Nantucket Police Department has not confirmed that. The attorney with Unruh noted that her son's accusations are \"well within\" both the civil and criminal statutes of limitations. USA Today has a list of the 14 people so far accusing Spacey of sexual assault or harassment.

On March 22, a military coup led by the National Council for the Recovery of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE) ousted President Amadou Toumani Touré, creating a power vacuum that has been exploited by separatist Tuareg rebels.\n\nThe rebels, who are primarily from the nomadic Tuareg people, have taken control of the northern part of Mali, including the key towns of Gao, Kidal, and Timbuktu. The rebels, who are divided into two groups - the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and Ansar Dine, which is linked to al-Qaeda - are seeking to establish an independent Tuareg state called Azawad.\n\nThe situation has been exacerbated by the fact that the Malian army is falling apart, and the junta has not sent any troops to defend the country from the rebels. West African leaders, including Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, have formed a diplomatic emergency committee to try and resolve the crisis, but their efforts have been hindered by the fact that some of the leaders involved have faced mutinies in their own countries.\n\nThe international community has been slow to respond to the crisis, but the African Union has joined West African nations in imposing sanctions on Mali, including a ban on fuel imports and a freeze on the country's bank account. The sanctions have had a significant impact on the country, with long lines forming at petrol stations and the country's electricity grid expected to falter in the coming weeks.\n\nThe crisis has also had a humanitarian impact, with over 200,000 people displaced and 13 million people in need of food aid. The UN Security Council is due to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis later this week.\n\nThe situation in Mali is complex and multifaceted, with a range of different groups and interests at play. However, one thing is clear: the country is on the brink of collapse, and the international community must act quickly to prevent a humanitarian disaster.\n\n**Key Developments:**\n\n* Military coup ousts President Amadou Toumani Touré on March 22\n* Separatist Tuareg rebels take control of northern Mali\n* West African leaders form diplomatic emergency committee to resolve crisis\n* African Union and West African nations impose sanctions on Mali\n*",

The UN worries that major food shortages could be imminent, and \"mayhem in these towns and cities is increasing,\" says a rep. Neighboring countries have established an embargo against the rebels who ousted the president; they've closed off their borders and frozen the country's regional bank account. That has prompted residents of Mali, which imports all its fuel, to rush to gas stations to collect fuel. The country's electricity grid may also be headed for failure. UNESCO is citing a threat to Timbuktu, a World Heritage Site full of \"architectural wonders,\" notes the BBC. Mosques there are \"essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of Mali,\" says the group. Yet \"nothing seems to be able to stop\" the Tuareg coup, Le Monde reports.

The organization estimates that there are approximately 8 million children separated from their families globally, with the majority being placed in institutions due to poverty, disability, or discrimination.\n\nAccording to Lumos, the vast majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but are unable to due to lack of resources or support. The charity emphasizes that the solution to this problem is not to improve the conditions within institutions, but to eliminate them altogether.\n\nResearch has shown that institutionalization causes measurable and sometimes irreparable harm to children, including malnutrition, developmental delays, and psychological trauma. In fact, studies have found that institutionalized children are far less likely to be educated, physically or mentally well, and are more likely to be abused or trafficked.\n\nLumos has achieved significant success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70%, 75%, and 54% respectively. The charity attributes this success to investment in inclusive education and health, support for vulnerable families, and the promotion of family-based care alternatives.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and Lumos is calling on them to prioritize funding for programs that support families and communities, rather than institutions. Ending child institutionalization not only has a moral imperative, but also makes excellent economic sense, as it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution.\n\nTo raise awareness about this issue, Lumos has launched a social media campaign, #Letstalklumos, which aims to create a global conversation about the need to end child institutionalization. With the support of international donors and the public, Lumos is confident that this goal can be achieved by 2050.\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n\n* 8 million children separated from their families worldwide\n* 70% reduction in children in institutions in Moldova since Lumos began working there in 2007\n* 75% fall in admissions to institutions in Lumos's demonstration area in the Czech Republic\n* 54% reduction in children in institutions in Bulgaria since Lumos began working there\n* 440% increase in foster carers in Bulgaria since Lumos began working there\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nJoin the global conversation about ending child",

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column.",

The incident has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Malaysia and North Korea, with both countries trading accusations and denials.\n\n**The Assassination**\n\nOn February 13, Kim Jong-nam was poisoned by two women, one Indonesian and one Vietnamese, who coated their hands with VX and wiped them on his face. He sought medical help at the airport, but died on the way to the hospital within two hours of the attack. The women, who are currently in custody, allegedly washed their hands immediately after the attack, but it is unclear whether they were given an antidote.\n\n**VX Nerve Agent**\n\nVX is a highly potent and deadly nerve agent, classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. It is a clear, amber-colored liquid that can be absorbed through the skin, eyes, or respiratory system, causing symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, runny nose, and watery eyes. In severe cases, it can cause convulsions, seizures, loss of consciousness, and paralysis, leading to death.\n\n**North Korea's Chemical Weapons Program**\n\nNorth Korea is believed to have a significant chemical weapons program, with an estimated 2,500 to 5,000 tons of nerve agents in stock, including VX.

However, the result is a hybrid that fails to work, with some critics calling it a \"toothless exercise in the obvious.\" The movie's makeup, provided by veteran Rick Baker, has been criticized for looking campy and dated. Del Toro's performance as Lawrence Talbot has been praised for its homage to Lon Chaney Jr.'s iconic portrayal, but it has also been criticized for being neutered and muted. The movie's action and atmosphere have been praised for their period piece flavor, but the special effects have been deemed dated.\n\n**Valentine's Day (2010)**\n\nIn contrast to \"The Wolfman,\" the romantic comedy \"Valentine's Day\" has been panned by critics. Directed by Garry Marshall, the movie features an ensemble cast, including Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts, and Ashton Kutcher. The movie has been criticized for its predictable plot, lack of humor, and overuse of rom-com cliches. The movie's cast, including Taylor Swift and Jamie Foxx, have also been criticized for their performances.\n\n**Ajami (2009)**\n\nOn the other hand, the Arab-Israeli drama \"Ajami\" has received widespread critical acclaim. Directed by Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani, the movie is a gritty and intense portrayal of life in an Israeli ghetto. The movie has been praised for its urgent and immediate storytelling, as well as its multicharacter portrayal of Arab life.\n\n**Red Riding Trilogy (2009)**\n\nThe \"Red Riding Trilogy\" has also been praised by critics for its taut and disturbing storytelling. Directed by Julian Jarrold, James Marsh, and Anand Tucker, the movie is an adaptation of David Peace's novels based on the Yorkshire Ripper murders. The movie has been praised for its all-star cast, including Paddy Considine and David Morrissey.\n\n**Classic Werewolf Movies**\n\nIn a separate article, critic John Anderson reviews classic werewolf movies, including the 1941 original \"The Wolf Man,\" \"An American Werewolf in London\" (1981), and \"Wolf\" (1994).

            "ground_truth": "Critics aren’t exactly howling over the new remake of The Wolfman starring Benicio del Toro, giving it mostly mediocre or failing marks. Here’s what they’re saying: “The movie is pungent with atmosphere, laying down a thick fog of creepy Victorian murk,” writes Kyle Smith of the New York Post, but the story is toothless, centering on a mystery “so simple that even Marmaduke could have sniffed it out.” “The movie is scary only as regards all its wasted potential,” laments John Anderson of the Wall Street Journal. There are good elements here, but they’re “reduced to a gruesome fondue, accessorized by actorly ham and studio cheese.” The filmmakers obviously loved the original Wolfman, but “nostalgia isn't always the best barometer,” writes James Berardinelli of ReelViews. The makeup is “inexcusably campy,” and scenes from the original are “recreated in a fashion that seems more Monty Python than unsettling.” But Ty Burr of the Boston Globe had fun. “The movie is by no means good,” he writes, “but it’s surprisingly enjoyable: a misty, moody Saturday-matinee monster-chiller-horror special.”",

Adams was arrested on Wednesday, May 1, under the Terrorism Act and was being questioned at Antrim police station. During his questioning, Adams maintained his innocence and claimed that the police had conducted a \"sustained, malicious, untruthful campaign\" against him.\n\n**Background of the Case**\n\nJean McConville, a 37-year-old widow and mother of 10, was abducted from her home in Belfast in December 1972 and was later found shot and buried on a beach in County Louth in 2003. Her son, Michael McConville, has been fighting for justice for his mother for over 40 years and has stated that the family will continue to pursue the case until they receive justice.\n\n**Adams' Response**\n\nAdams claimed that he had contacted the police two months ago about the McConville case and had gone voluntarily to the police station last week. He questioned the timing of his arrest, which he said was politically motivated, and claimed that the police could have used discretion rather than arresting him. Adams also stated that he had been presented with old photographs and interviews conducted by people who were \"enemies of the peace process.\"\n\n**Reaction from Other Parties**\n\nOther political parties have rejected claims that the timing of the arrest was political. Democratic Unionist Jeffrey Donaldson stated that the police had the right to investigate murder at any time, while Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said that the McConville family's 42-year wait for truth and justice made Adams' complaint about the delay seem \"churlish.\" Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Alasdair McDonnell questioned the timing of the arrest, while Northern Ireland Justice Minister David Ford said that politicians should not interfere in policing.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nThe decision to release Adams means that prosecution lawyers will now decide if charges will be brought. The file sent by the police to the Public Prosecution Service will detail the evidence gathered, and it will be up to the lawyers to decide if there is enough evidence to bring charges and what those charges would be. The case is a significant development in the investigation into the IRA's activities during the Troubles, and it is likely to have a major impact on the peace process in Northern Ireland.\n\n**",

Davis writes that she could feel the baby's body tremble violently, and she knew that she needed to end the pregnancy to spare the baby from suffering.\n\nIn addition to the abortion, Davis also writes about ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy in 1994, which was considered medically necessary. Davis says that she considered revealing the terminated pregnancies during her filibuster, but decided against it, fearing that it would overshadow the events of the day.\n\nThe memoir, which goes on sale Tuesday, also delves into Davis' personal life, including her struggles as a young mother, her relationship with her first husband, and her journey to becoming a state senator and gubernatorial candidate.\n\n**Reaction from Abortion Rights Advocates and Opponents**\n\nAbortion rights advocates have praised Davis for her \"unwavering courage\" in sharing her story, while anti-abortion groups have expressed sympathy for the difficult choice she faced, but emphasized the value of life.\n\nCecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, praised Davis for shining a light on a subject that is often hidden in shame and stigma. \"We are grateful to her for sharing her story and for her unwavering commitment to protecting women's access to reproductive health care,\" Richards said.\n\nTexans Right to Life spokeswoman Melissa Conway expressed sympathy for Davis' decision, but emphasized that the value of life is precious. \"While our heart goes out to the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious,\" Conway said.\n\n**Impact on Gubernatorial Campaign**\n\nThe revelation is likely to have an impact on Davis' gubernatorial campaign against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to win.

The San Antonio Express-News and the AP obtained advanced copies, and the news is generating headlines given that Davis shot to national fame while filibustering against an abortion bill in Texas. Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized. After the abortion, \"an indescribable blackness followed,\" writes Davis in Forgetting to Be Afraid, \"and when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person.\" Davis also writes of a previously disclosed procedure to terminate an earlier ectopic pregnancy in which the embryo was implanted outside the uterus.

He would set up meetings and rates with prospective clients, and Van Wert would allow some of the meetings to take place in his third-floor apartment at a senior living facility in exchange for drugs and cash.\n\nLambach would transport the women to and from specific locations, waiting until they were done, and would take a significant cut of the women's money or pay them in heroin, cocaine, or prescription drugs in lieu of cash. Some of the women he recruited were formerly his foster children.\n\nThe investigation revealed that Lambach had been involved in prostitution and trafficking for about 10 years, and had even threatened the women if he thought they were giving information to the police. One witness estimated that Lambach had recruited and transported about 10 other women in a similar manner.\n\nPolice received reports of increased prostitution in Pittsfield earlier this year, and began investigating in the spring of 2017. The investigation involved the Pittsfield Police Department detective bureau, anti-crime unit, drug unit, as well as members of the state police detective unit assigned to the District Attorney's Office.\n\nLambach has pleaded not guilty to four counts of human trafficking, while Van Wert has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit human trafficking, deriving support from prostitution, maintaining a house of prostitution, and sexual conduct for a fee.

The site, which dates back to 2,400 BC, is believed to be one of the largest prehistoric monuments in the country. Archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved rectangular building, which is thought to have been used for gatherings and feasts. The building, which is as neatly levelled and regular as modern post-war bungalows, has produced a range of finds, including beautifully worked flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. Analysis of the site suggests that it was used for status and power displays, with the ability to mobilize a massive workforce.\n\n**Wilsford Henge: A 4,000-Year-Old Child's Burial**\n\nAt the Wilsford Henge site, archaeologists have discovered a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child. The body was found lying in a foetal position, wearing an amber necklace. Scientific analysis of the skeleton is expected to provide information on the child's gender, diet, pathologies, and date of burial, as well as shed light on where the child lived.\n\n**Understanding the People of Stonehenge**\n\nThe excavations at Marden Henge and Wilsford Henge are part of a larger project aimed at gaining a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.

A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

However, the company's preliminary results showed that a majority of investors rejected the pay decisions, with some shareholders publicly criticizing the move.\n\nThe vote is seen as a significant moment in the debate over executive pay, with some experts warning that it could lead to tougher regulations on corporate governance in the UK.

The investigator, Felix Murga, had told Peruvians that four suspected murderers apprehended by police were \"Pishtacos\" - the legendary killers who roam the Andes mountains extracting fat from travelers.\n\nAccording to the legend, the Pishtacos strung-up the torsos of their victims above candles and heated them to collect fat. Police initially said the gang murdered up to 60 victims and exported their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to Italian cosmetics makers. However, it has now been revealed that there may have been only one victim, and the four alleged killers may have bottled his fat to intimidate their rivals in an area rife with drug trafficking and violence.\n\nThe police's botched investigation has been harshly criticized, with anthropologists saying investigators foolishly believed the Pishtacos legend when searching for a motive for the murder, and then played on people's fears by turning the legend into reality. Medical experts have also dismissed the theory that human fat has monetary value, saying it would be pointless to kill people to harvest their fat when it could be easily collected from plastic surgery clinics that perform tummy tucks.\n\nThe police's reputation has been severely damaged, with the head of Peru's police, General Miguel Hidalgo, saying he was embarrassed by the investigation. Politicians have also criticized the police for scaring away tourists, with the president of the region of Huanuco calling the story a \"ruse of bad taste.\"\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the police's ability to investigate crimes and the use of myths and legends to explain complex cases. It has also highlighted the need for more effective communication and transparency in law enforcement.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Peru's top organized crime investigator, Eusebio Felix, has been put on leave for misleading the public.\n* The investigator claimed to have caught a gang of serial killers who acted out an ancient Andean legend and sold their victims' fat.\n* There may have been only one victim, and the four alleged killers may have bottled his fat to intimidate their rivals.\n* The police's botched investigation has been harshly criticized by anthropologists and medical experts.\n* The police's reputation has been severely damaged, and politicians have criticized the police for scaring",

According to the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA), more than 4,000 long-distance hiking permits have been issued in 2016, with over 3,000 hikers attempting the Northbound thru-hike. This surge in numbers has raised concerns about overcrowding and the potential impact on the trail and its environment.\n\nThe PCTA has implemented a permit system with a 50-per-day cap to mitigate wear on the trail and environmental damage. However, this system may not be enough to prevent overcrowding, especially during the high season. The desert environments that dominate the first 700 miles of the trail are particularly vulnerable to damage, and the PCTA is considering the possibility of installing shelters to reduce the impact of hikers.\n\nThe increased number of hikers has also led to a rise in helicopter evacuations and searches, which can be costly and resource-intensive. In 2016, there were already 20 rescues in the first 50 miles of the trail by April 26.\n\nDespite the challenges, many hikers are drawn to the PCT for its transformative power and natural beauty. The trail has become a popular destination for those seeking adventure, self-discovery, and a chance to connect with nature. However, it is essential for hikers to be aware of their impact on the trail and its environment and to practice responsible and sustainable hiking practices.\n\nThe PCTA has launched a campaign, #responsiblywild, to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" practices among hikers. This includes protecting water quality, burying human waste, packing out trash, and building safe campfires.\n\nIn addition to the PCT, other long-distance hiking trails, such as the Appalachian Trail, are also experiencing increased popularity. The movie \"A Walk in the Woods,\" based on Bill Bryson's book, is set to be released later this year and may further boost interest in long-distance hiking.\n\nOverall, the Pacific Crest Trail is facing a unique set of challenges as it becomes increasingly popular. While the trail's transformative power and natural beauty continue to draw hikers from around the world, it is essential for hikers to be aware of their impact on the trail and its environment and to practice responsible and sustainable hiking practices.\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n\n* Over 4",

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")",

The dinosaur, named Caihong juji, lived around 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period and is considered one of the most colorful dinosaurs to have ever existed.\n\n**Description of Caihong juji**\n\nCaihong juji was a small, crow-sized dinosaur with a bird-like body and a crested head that resembles a Velociraptor. Its feathers were remarkably well-preserved, with some areas showing iridescent colors that are similar to those found in modern hummingbirds. The dinosaur's head, chest, and parts of its tail had long, flat melanosomes that were organized into sheets, creating a metallic sheen that changed color with the viewing angle.\n\n**Feathered Display**\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji's feathers suggests that they may have been used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The dinosaur's frond-like tail had asymmetrical feathers with short, stiff leading edges that would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight. This adaptation is a key feature of modern birds and is now known to have existed in Caihong, making it the oldest known animal to possess this trait.\n\n**Evolutionary Significance**\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their role in dinosaur biology. The dinosaur's iridescent feathers are similar to those found in modern hummingbirds, which suggests that these colors may have evolved independently in different species. The study also highlights the diversity of feathered dinosaurs and their complex behaviors, which are still not fully understood.\n\n**Future Research**\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has sparked new questions about the biology and behavior of these ancient creatures. Researchers are eager to learn more about the dinosaur's habits, its social structure, and how it used its iridescent feathers. Further study of the fossil and potentially more discoveries will help to shed light on the fascinating world of feathered dinosaurs.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* Caihong juji was a small, crow-sized dinosaur with a bird-like body and a crested head.\n* Its feathers were remarkably well-preserved, with some areas showing iridescent colors similar to those found in modern hummingbirds.\n* The dinosaur's frond-like tail had asymmetrical feathers with short, stiff leading edges that would have borne the",
            "ground_truth": "Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The show, which debuted in 1996, followed the pair as they traveled the UK in a motorcycle-sidecar, cooking and sharing their love of food.\n\nDickson Wright was a brilliant cook, an erudite food historian, and a champion of hunting and shooting. She was known for her strong opinions and fiery temper, which earned her the nickname \"Krakatoa.\" Despite her tough exterior, she was a kind and generous person who loved nothing more than sharing her passion for food with others.\n\nAfter Paterson's death in 1999, Dickson Wright continued to work in television, appearing in several shows, including \"Clarissa and the Countryman\" and \"Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.\" She was also a prolific writer, publishing several books, including \"A History of English Food\" and \"Clarissa's England.\"\n\nDickson Wright's life was not without its challenges. She struggled with alcoholism and was declared bankrupt several times after spending her £2.8 million inheritance on \"drinking and debauchery.\" However, she eventually overcame her addiction and went on to lead a fulfilling life, saying, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\"\n\nThroughout her career, Dickson Wright was known for her love of traditional British cuisine and her disdain for modern-day political correctness. She was a fierce advocate for rural life and a keen supporter of the Countryside Alliance, which led to controversy when she suggested that people should eat the meat of badgers that had been culled.\n\nDickson Wright is survived by her two sisters, Heather and June, and will be remembered as a true original, a brilliant cook, and a passionate advocate for the things she believed in. Her legacy will live on through her cookbooks, television shows, and the countless people whose lives she touched through her love of food and her infectious enthusiasm.\n\nIn a statement, her agent, Heather Holden-Brown, said, \"Her fun and laughter, extraordinary learning and intelligence, will be missed always, by so many of us.\" Celebrity chef Brian Turner described her as a \"very intelligent lady\" who was \"very outgoing\" and knew what good service",
            "ground_truth": "Both of TV's \"Fat Ladies\" have sung. Clarissa Dickson Wright, one half of the BBC's \"Two Fat Ladies\" cooking duo, died in Edinburgh Saturday at age 66, the BBC reports. Wright was a former lawyer who filmed four of the \"Fat Ladies\" series, going on food-related road trips across the UK in a motorbike and sidecar with Jennifer Paterson, before Paterson died in 1999 from cancer. The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year.",

The incident occurred on March 25, when Wilson and her husband, Gary, decided not to reach the summit due to approaching dusk.\n\nUsing only Gary's smartphone to navigate, they headed across the mountain's west face, known for its loose rocks and steep inclines. Jane Wilson, an experienced mountain walker and academic engagement librarian at the University of Manchester, went ahead to look for a suitable route. After asking her husband if it was safe, she fell 20-30 feet down a vertical cliff and tumbled about 150 meters down into an area known as Notch arrete.\n\nGary Wilson, who was following behind, realized his wife had fallen and climbed to a safer ledge to raise the alarm. Members of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team were called to the scene and eventually led Gary to safety. However, the team leader, Detective Constable Tim Bird, was hit by falling rocks while abseiling down to the spot where Jane's body was found.\n\nThe inquest into Jane Wilson's death heard that the couple had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years and that Jane was a fit and active woman. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death.\n\n**Safety Concerns Raised**\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the use of smartphone apps for navigation in mountainous terrain. Experts have warned that electronic maps can be limited in detail and that batteries can run out at critical moments. Mountain Rescue England and Wales has urged walkers to use a map and compass in addition to electronic navigation aids.\n\nChris Lloyd, a member of the Ogwen Rescue team, described the route taken by the couple as \"not a straightforward path\" and warned that Tryfan is responsible for about 30% of the incidents the team attends. Andy Simpson, a spokesman for Mountain Rescue England and Wales, also emphasized the importance of using a map and compass, saying that \"there is no easy way up Tryfan but there are easier routes.\"\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the risks involved in mountain walking and the importance of being prepared and using the right equipment.",
            "ground_truth": "A hiker's fatal fall in March has been blamed on using a smartphone app map instead of an actual map. The BBC reports Jane Wilson and her husband Gary were hiking on Tryfan in Wales when it started to get dark and they decided to skip the summit. While attempting to descend the mountain, Gary was looking at an Ordnance Survey app while Jane went a short way ahead to make sure the path was safe, according to the Telegraph. The Manchester Evening News reports Gary heard his wife fall, got to safety, and called for help. Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull. At a hearing Friday, Jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \"Apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most,\" the Telegraph quotes a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales as saying. A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest. A director with Ordnance Survey says hikers should always use the app in conjunction with an actual map \"due to the nature of mobile devices when navigating the real world.\" Authorities also say Jane wasn't wearing appropriate footwear for the hike.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) stated that the United States needs to leave \"all options on the table\" in dealing with Pakistan after U.S. military officials accused the country's intelligence officials of assisting terrorist operations. Graham emphasized that Pakistan was engaged in \"hostile acts against the U.S.\" and that the country needs to be put on notice.\n\n**White House Staff and Cabinet**\n\nPresident Barack Obama's senior adviser, David Plouffe, stated that he doesn't expect significant changes in top White House staff or the Cabinet ahead of the 2012 reelection campaign.

However, the results have been far from successful, with Seattle and Cook County experiencing significant backlash from consumers and businesses.\n\n**Seattle's Soda Tax**\n\nSeattle's 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, implemented in 2018, has been a disaster. The tax has nearly doubled the price of some drinks, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33. As a result, customers are voting with their feet, buying drinks in the suburbs to avoid the tax. Costco, a popular retailer, has even posted signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the product without paying the massive tax.\n\n**Cook County's Soda Tax**\n\nCook County, Illinois, implemented a similar tax in 2017, but it was repealed just two months later due to a tremendous public outcry. The tax had a significant impact on businesses, with Costco's nine locations in the county seeing a 34% decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax. The tax also triggered numerous lawsuits, some of which are still pending.\n\n**Statewide Soda Tax Proposal**\n\nA bill to bring a sugary drink tax statewide has been re-introduced in Washington state, but it is unlikely to pass. The tax would add nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, and some businesses are worried about the impact on their bottom line.\n\n**Consumer Backlash**\n\nConsumers are not happy with the tax, with many feeling that it is regressive and disproportionately affects low-income families. Some are also questioning why the tax leaves out sugar-heavy beverages like those sold at Starbucks. A Twitter thread by Scott Drenkard of the Tax Foundation highlights the inconsistencies in the argument for the tax, with some public health advocates saying that the tax is too small to elicit behavior change, while others claim that it will have a significant impact.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe tax has had a significant economic impact, with businesses losing revenue and some even having to lay off workers. Seattle is seeing a decline in tax revenue, as consumers are buying drinks in the suburbs to avoid the tax. The city's leaders had hoped to raise $15 million from the tax, but it is unlikely to meet that goal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe soda tax has been a failure in Seattle and Cook County",
            "ground_truth": "\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide. (Speaking of Seattle and beverages, the world's largest Starbucks is no longer located there.)",

According to a recent analysis by the North Coast Journal, between 2000 and 2016, Humboldt County averaged 717 missing persons reports per 100,000 residents, compared to the statewide average of 384. The county's high rate of missing persons has led to concerns about the safety and well-being of its residents, particularly those involved in the cannabis industry.\n\n**The Humboldt 35**\n\nThe North Coast Journal's investigation into the county's missing persons cases revealed that 35 individuals are currently listed as missing on the California Attorney General's website. These individuals, known as the \"Humboldt 35,\" range in age from 1 to 94 and include men, women, and children. While some of these individuals may have been victims of crime, others may have simply chosen to disappear or be out of contact with their families.\n\n**Cannabis Industry Connection**\n\nThe cannabis industry has been identified as a contributing factor to the high rate of missing persons in Humboldt County. Many individuals involved in the industry come to the area to work on remote farms, often without cell phone service or regular contact with their families. This can make it difficult for law enforcement to investigate missing persons cases, as friends and family may not be aware of their whereabouts.\n\n**Investigations and Challenges**\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in Humboldt County, including the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department, have been working to investigate missing persons cases. However, these investigations can be challenging due to the remote nature of the area and the lack of cooperation from some individuals involved in the cannabis industry.\n\n**Cases of Interest**\n\nSeveral cases of missing persons in Humboldt County have garnered attention in recent years. These include the disappearance of Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner from Los Angeles who was last seen in 2014. His sister, Vikki Joseph, has been working to keep his case in the public eye and has expressed frustration with the lack of progress in the investigation.\n\n**Update**\n\nIn a recent update, the North Coast Journal received a call from Daniel Ogden Stromberg, who was reported missing in May 2017.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people.

The app, Xora, was required by her employer to track her every move, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even when she was off the clock.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias was a sales executive for Intermex from February 2014 to May 2014, earning around $7,250 per month. She was asked to download the Xora app, which contained a global positioning system function that tracked her exact location. Arias researched the app and asked her boss, John Stubits, if Intermex would be tracking her whereabouts when she was off the clock. Stubits admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\n\nArias objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, likening the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informing Stubits that his actions were illegal. However, Stubits replied that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion because Intermex was paying her more than her previous employer, NetSpend Corporation.\n\nAfter Arias uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, she was scolded by Stubits and fired a few weeks later. The lawsuit alleges that Intermex's actions were a violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest, but if an employee cannot stop it, then that is a complete violation of laws against invasion of privacy.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Intermex's president and CEO, Robert Lisy, interfered with Arias' contract with NetSpend Corporation, resulting in her termination from NetSpend. Arias seeks an injunction and general, special, and punitive damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination, and unfair business practices.\n\nThis case highlights the importance of employee privacy and the need for employers to balance legitimate business interests with the rights of their employees. The outcome of this case will likely have significant implications for employers and employees alike.\n\n**Background on Xora App**\n\nThe Xora app is a location-tracking app that enables employees to create electronic timecards",
            "ground_truth": "Myrna Arias didn't like the GPS app on her phone that constantly tracked her, so she uninstalled it. The problem: Arias' iPhone was issued by her employer, which required her to run the app constantly, and after she removed it, the California woman was fired. Now she's suing her former employer, money transfer service Intermex, for invasion of privacy, unfair business practices, and retaliation, among other things, Ars Technica reports. Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says. Arias says her boss \"scolded\" her for uninstalling the program last year, and fired her soon after. (Elsewhere, a woman got fired over a text mistakenly sent to the boss.)",

The first incident occurred in Phoenix, Arizona, where a man named Leslie Allen Merritt Jr. was charged with four freeway shootings that took place in August and September 2015. Merritt was initially held on a $1 million bond but was recently released from jail after a judge reduced his bond to zero and allowed him to return home under electronic monitoring.\n\nMerritt's defense lawyers have raised questions about the evidence linking him to the crimes, citing ballistic tests and phone records that they claim provide an alibi for their client. The judge overseeing the case, Warren Granville, has imposed a gag order on lawyers, preventing them from discussing the evidence.\n\nIn a separate incident, a driver suspected of firing a gun at motorists on an Alabama highway was killed in a shootout with law enforcement. The incident occurred in Blount County, Alabama, where 911 dispatchers received reports of a driver opening fire on motorists on U.S. 278. The suspect fled from officers and crashed his vehicle, leading to an exchange of gunfire. The suspect was later pronounced dead, but no other details, including the suspect's name or the officer's identity, have been released.\n\nBoth incidents highlight the dangers of freeway shootings and the importance of thorough investigations to bring perpetrators to justice. While Merritt's release has raised questions about the evidence against him, the Alabama incident serves as a reminder of the risks faced by law enforcement officers and the public during such incidents.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Leslie Allen Merritt Jr. was released from jail after a judge reduced his bond to zero in connection with four freeway shootings in Phoenix, Arizona.\n* Merritt's defense lawyers have raised questions about the evidence linking him to the crimes.\n* A driver suspected of firing a gun at motorists on an Alabama highway was killed in a shootout with law enforcement.\n* The Alabama incident highlights the dangers of freeway shootings and the importance of thorough investigations to bring perpetrators to justice.",

The judge overseeing the case of Leslie Merritt Jr. reduced his bond to zero and said he can return to his home under electronic monitoring, the AP reports. He was expected to be released later in the day. The reduction of the bond—once $1 million—was a major victory as defense lawyers contend that ballistic tests cast doubt on the claim by authorities that Merritt was behind four of the freeway shootings. \"With all due respect your honor, there's no evidence against him to show he's responsible for this,\" defense lawyer Jason Lamm said. \"He is no more the I-10 shooter than, respectfully, you are.\" Merritt lifted up his shackled arms in celebration as he walked from the courtroom. After the hearing, family members hugged and shook the hands of defense lawyers. Merritt has pleaded not guilty to drive-by shooting, aggravated assault, and other charges. The shootings caused panic on Phoenix-area freeways, where 11 vehicles were hit in August and September. Detectives took Merritt into custody on Sept. 18; in court the next day, Merritt adamantly denied shooting any cars, telling the judge, \"I'm the wrong guy.\" His lawyers immediately began raising questions about the evidence, citing ballistics information and phone records they say provided an alibi for their client.

The shooter, identified as Snochia Moseley, was a disgruntled employee who used a 9mm Glock pistol and multiple magazines. The motive for the shooting is still unknown.\n\nThe shooting occurred at around 9:06 a.m. at the Rite Aid distribution center in Perryman, near Aberdeen. Deputies and other first responders arrived within five minutes, and the shooter was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Two victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and four others were taken to hospitals, with two in stable condition and two seriously injured.\n\n**Pennsylvania Shooting**\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a gunman opened fire outside a judge's office in a municipal building in Masontown, Pennsylvania, injuring four people, including a police officer. The suspect, Patrick Dowdell, 61, was shot and killed by police.\n\n**Wisconsin Shooting**\n\nOn Wednesday, a 43-year-old co-worker shot four people at a software company, WTS Paradigm, in Middleton, Wisconsin. The gunman was shot and killed by police, and three of the injured were in serious condition.\n\n**Previous Shootings in Maryland**\n\nThis incident marks the third workplace shooting in Harford County, Maryland, in the past year. In October 2017, three co-workers were killed at a kitchen countertop company in Edgewood, and two others were injured. The suspect, Radee L. Prince, is awaiting trial on murder and firearm charges.\n\n**Government Response**\n\nMaryland Governor Larry Hogan offered his condolences to the families of the victims and praised the swift response of law enforcement and emergency personnel. The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting in the investigation.\n\n**Community Response**\n\nThe Rite Aid distribution center has been closed, and grief counselors will be made available to employees. The facility is expected to reopen once the investigation is complete.

Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler said she was a temporary employee at the Rite Aid distribution center where the shooting took place, reports the Baltimore Sun. Police say the suspect killed three people, and three others remain hospitalized with wounds not believed to be life threatening.

Deputies got there at 9:06am, within 5 minutes of the first call, said the sheriff. He said that deputies fired no shots and that the shooter used a 9mm Glock semiautomatic handgun. Why: Police aren't speculating about a motive. “Normally, she was a nice person, but she came in in a bad mood,” Mike Carre, an employee at a nearby business, tells the Washington Post, recounting what Rite Aid workers told him. \"She wanted to pick a fight,\" he said. \"And then she started shooting.” CNN quotes a law enforcement official who describes her as a disgruntled employee; the site says she worked there as a security guard.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD-like behaviors.\n\nWhile the study does not show a clear cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD, the researchers suggest that the medication may interfere with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. The study's authors also note that the risk of ADHD-like behaviors was higher in children whose mothers took acetaminophen for longer periods, with a 50% increased risk for receiving ADHD medication when mothers reported use for 20 weeks or more.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns among health experts, who are urging pregnant women to be cautious when using acetaminophen. Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor and chair of the epidemiology department at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, advises pregnant women to try to avoid taking painkillers as much as possible until more is known about the risks.\n\n**What Does This Mean for Pregnant Women?**\n\nWhile the study does not recommend that pregnant women completely avoid acetaminophen, it does suggest that they should use caution when taking the medication. The American Medical Association recommends that pregnant women talk to their doctors before taking any medication, including acetaminophen.\n\nHealth experts also suggest that pregnant women explore non-pharmacological ways to deal with pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture. Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, head of maternal-fetal medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, notes that \"there are nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain, and I think we have to focus a little bit more on that as opposed to just medications.\"\n\n**What Does the Manufacturer Say?**\n\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol, has released a statement saying that the company is aware of the study's findings, but notes that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\n\n**What's Next?**\n\nThe study",

The risk increased the later in pregnancy the drug was taken and the longer it was taken. Women who used acetaminophen for 20 weeks or longer had a 50% higher chance of their children being prescribed ADHD medication. But the authors did not find a cause-and-effect relationship, and they note that \"exhibiting ADHD-like behaviors\" is not the same as actually having ADHD. Right now, doctors consider acetaminophen the \"safest\" pain reliever for pregnant women, NBC News reports; the study author says pregnant women \"shouldn't worry at this point.\" What could account for the link?

Judge Steven T. O'Neill also ruled that Cosby qualified as a \"sexually violent predator\" under state law, requiring him to receive monthly counseling for the rest of his life.\n\nCosby's defense team, led by publicist Andrew Wyatt, made fiery accusations of racism and sexism in statements outside the courthouse, framing their client's downfall as an unjust product of the #MeToo era.

Kavanaugh, who is embroiled in controversy after two women accused him of sexual assault and misconduct in incidents dating back to the 1980s.\n\nWyatt claimed that Cosby and Kavanaugh are victims of a \"sex war\" that is \"going on in Washington today.\" He also called Cosby's trial \"the most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States,\" and claimed that Cosby was \"one of the greatest civil rights leaders\" and a \"great educator of men and boys.\" Wyatt also criticized the psychologists who testified against Cosby, and claimed that audio footage of Cosby played in the courtroom was falsified.\n\nCosby spent his first night behind bars at SCI Phoenix, a new 3,830-bed state prison in suburban Philadelphia.

When she repeated it was polls, he responded, \"OK, which polls?” and Keilar said: “All of them.\" USA Today reports that Twitter users were quick to mock Cohen and are now replying \"Says who?\" to all his tweets. Cohen, in what Law Newz calls \"typical lawyer fashion,\" also took issue with Trump's overhaul of campaign staff being called a \"shake-up,\" insisting it was actually a \"change-up.\" Cohen also raised eyebrows when he told Kielar that Trump knows about \"the African-American problem in this country,\" the Independent reports. \"What I meant to say is the problem that exists in the African-American community,\" he later said. (Michael Moore says he \"knows for a fact\" that Trump never really wanted to be president.)",

The incident occurred on Monday and was captured on cellphone video by students in the class.\n\nAccording to the sheriff, Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott, Fields was initially suspended without pay and an internal investigation was launched to determine whether he had violated department policies. The investigation concluded that Fields' actions were \"not acceptable\" and that he had used excessive force in removing the student.\n\nThe student, who has not been identified, was charged with disturbing schools and released to her parents. Her attorney, Todd Rutherford, said that she suffered several injuries during the arrest, including a cast on her arm, neck and back injuries, and a rug burn on her forehead.\n\nThe incident began when the student became disruptive in her algebra class and refused to leave when asked by her teacher and an administrator. Fields was called to the classroom and used a forearm to wrap around the student's neck, flipped her and the desk backward onto the floor, and then dragged her and her desk across the floor.\n\nThe sheriff acknowledged that the student's behavior was unruly, but said that it did not justify Fields' actions. Lott said that Fields had no prior complaints against him during his seven years at Spring Valley, but that his actions on Monday were enough to warrant his termination.\n\nThe FBI, the Justice Department, and state law enforcement have opened separate investigations into the incident, including a civil rights probe. The president of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP has called for Fields to be charged with assault.\n\nSchool district officials have blasted Fields' actions as \"outrageous\" and \"reprehensible,\" and the video itself as \"shamefully shocking.\" The district is strengthening its training efforts with school resource officers to ensure such an incident does not happen again.\n\nFields has a history of allegations of racial bias and excessive force, including a 2013 case in which he was accused of targeting blacks and falsely accusing a student of being a gang member. He has also been the subject of a lawsuit in which a black couple accused him of excessive force and battery during a noise complaint arrest in 2005.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage and calls for greater accountability among law enforcement officers in schools.",
            "ground_truth": "The school resource officer suspended after videos of him throwing a black female high-school student around a South Carolina classroom went viral Monday has been fired, CBS News reports. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott announced the firing of Ben Fields Wednesday after an investigation found his \"use of force was unacceptable\" and he didn't follow procedure during the arrest. According to NBC News, the decision was made after the sheriff's department looked at videos of the incident and interviewed witnesses. \"From the very beginning that's what's caused me to be upset, and continued to upset me, is that he picked the student up and threw the student across the room,\" Lott says. The Department of Justice is also conducting its own investigation into the incident. This isn't the first time Fields, who is white, has faced accusations of excessive force and racial bias. He's been involved in three other such cases dating back to 2005, and he's scheduled to go to trial over a 2013 racial bias incident in January.",

His wife, Gloria Hiroko Chapman, has spoken out about their relationship and her unwavering devotion to him despite his heinous crime. Gloria, 67, revealed that her husband had told her two months before the murder that he planned to kill Lennon, but she believed him when he said he had dumped the gun and changed his mind due to his love for her.\n\nHowever, when news of Lennon's death broke, Gloria knew immediately that her husband was responsible. Despite being urged by friends to divorce him, Gloria refused, citing her Christian faith and the vows they exchanged when they married in 1979. She has been allowed to visit Chapman in prison, where they have spent 44 hours a year together in a caravan, making pizzas, watching TV, and making love.\n\nGloria's devotion to Chapman has been met with criticism, particularly from Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, who has objected to his parole. However, the New York State parole board has been more willing to consider an inmate's behavior behind bars, and several notorious murderers have been released in recent years.\n\nChapman's parole hearing is due to be held in August, and Gloria is hopeful that he will be released after 38 years behind bars. She has been praying for his freedom and believes that her husband's acceptance of his crime and his faith in Jesus will ultimately lead to his release.\n\n**Related News:**\n\n* The Internet Archive is working to archive web pages and fix broken links on the web by preserving the version of a page that was live when it was written.\n* The archive aims to provide a link to the original version of a page, even if the original page is no longer available.\n\n**Key Figures:**\n\n* Mark David Chapman: The man who assassinated John Lennon in 1980 and is set to face his 10th parole hearing.\n* Gloria Hiroko Chapman: Mark David Chapman's wife, who has spoken out about her devotion to him despite his crime.\n* Yoko Ono: John Lennon's widow, who has objected to Mark David Chapman's parole.\n* John Lennon: The musician who was assassinated by Mark David Chapman in 1980.",

            "output": "\"The Lovely Bones\" is a film adaptation of Alice Sebold's bestselling novel, directed by Peter Jackson and starring Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci, Mark Wahlberg, and Rachel Weisz. The story revolves around Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl who is murdered by her neighbor George Harvey in 1973. Susie's spirit remains in a limbo between heaven and earth, where she watches her family and killer go on with their lives.\n\nThe film has received mixed reviews from critics. Some praise Ronan's performance as Susie, calling it \"enormously gifted\" and \"radiant.\" They also commend Jackson's ability to recreate the story's imaginative and fantastical elements, such as the \"in-between\" world where Susie spends her time. However, others criticize the film's tone, which they find to be inconsistent and overly sentimental.\n\nOne of the main criticisms of the film is its focus on the more disturbing and violent aspects of the story, such as the murder and the killer's lair. While Tucci's performance as George Harvey is praised for its unsettling and malevolent nature, some critics feel that the film's emphasis on these elements detracts from the story's overall balance and tone.\n\nIn contrast, the film's portrayal of Susie's family and their grief is seen as more effective. Wahlberg and Weisz are praised for their performances as Susie's parents, and the film's depiction of their struggles to cope with their loss is seen as poignant and moving.\n\nOverall, \"The Lovely Bones\" is a film that has received mixed reviews from critics. While it has its moments of beauty and poignancy, it is also marred by its inconsistent tone and overemphasis on the more disturbing aspects of the story. Despite this, the film's performances and imaginative elements are worth watching, and it is a must-see for fans of the novel.\n\nRating: 2.5/4 stars\n\nRecommendation: \"The Lovely Bones\" is a film that will appeal to fans of the novel and those who enjoy fantasy and drama. However, it may not be suitable for all audiences due to its mature themes and violent content.",

The footage, released by Mexican media outlets, is believed to have been recorded during a clash between soldiers and suspected oil thieves in Palmarito, Puebla State, on May 3, 2017. The incident has sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an investigation into the use of extrajudicial force by the Mexican military.\n\nAccording to reports, the video shows a silver car being ambushed by soldiers, with the driver and passengers being forced to the ground. One of the men, who appears to be still alive, is dragged to a well-lit area and left lying on the ground for six minutes before being shot in the back of the head by a soldier. The incident has been described as a \"serious crisis of violence and impunity\" by human rights groups.\n\nThe Mexican defense ministry has urged federal prosecutors to investigate the video, stating that the incident must be \"irrefutably\" cleared up by federal investigators. The ministry has also pledged to cooperate with the attorney general's office in the investigation.\n\nThis is not the first time the Mexican military has been implicated in extrajudicial killings. In 2014, soldiers were accused of executing at least a dozen suspects after they surrendered in the town of Tlatlaya. Three soldiers are currently in prison over the incident.\n\nThe video has sparked outrage and calls for greater accountability from the Mexican government. Human rights groups have long criticized the military's use of force, citing a pattern of extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the ongoing crisis of violence and impunity in Mexico, which has seen a significant increase in murders and gang-related violence in recent years.

Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Communications Director was fired in late July 2017, just two weeks after his appointment. His tenure was marked by controversy, including protocol breaches with the FBI and conflicting statements about his relationship with then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The outgoing Governor of New Jersey has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the country. His reputation was sullied by the Bridgegate scandal, in which allies created a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge in 2013. Christie's decision to fawn over Donald Trump after the presidential election also damaged his reputation.\n\n3. **James Comey**: The former Director of the FBI was fired by President Donald Trump in May 2017, just five months into his presidency. Comey's tenure was marked by controversy, including his public attacks on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's judgment and his announcement of an FBI investigation into Clinton just days before the election.\n\n4. **Mark Fields**: The former CEO of Ford Motor Company was let go in May 2017, largely due to his failure to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure as CEO, despite corporate revenue climbing over 5% from 2014 to 2016.\n\n5. **Tiger Woods**: The professional golfer has been embroiled in controversy on and off the course since reports of his infidelity came to light in 2009. His latest scandal was a DUI arrest in 2017, which led to a significant drop in his golf ranking. Woods is currently ranked 899, his lowest ranking ever.\n\nThese individuals, among others, serve as a reminder that power, wealth, and fame can be fleeting. Circumstances can change rapidly, and fortunes can be lost overnight.",

The House of Representatives has passed a plan to fund federal agencies through December 15, but it includes conditions related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama have vowed to reject.\n\n**House Republicans' Strategy**\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has been under pressure from conservative Republicans to delay the implementation of the ACA, and his plan includes a one-year delay in the law's implementation and a repeal of the medical device tax. However, Senate Democrats and President Obama have made it clear that they will not accept any changes to the law, and Boehner's plan is unlikely to pass the Senate.\n\n**Senate Democrats' Strategy**\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has taken a hardline stance against the House Republicans' plan, and has urged President Obama to reject any compromise that includes changes to the ACA. Reid believes that the Republicans will ultimately cave to Democratic demands and pass a clean stopgap measure to keep the government funded.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors in the nation, is expected to be hit hard by a government shutdown. Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown could also have a ripple effect on state and local governments, which rely on federal funding for essential services such as Meals on Wheels and emergency preparedness training.\n\n**Consequences of a Shutdown**\n\nA government shutdown would have widespread consequences, including:\n\n* Federal agencies would close, and nonessential employees would be furloughed\n* Mail would continue to be delivered, but with delays\n* Federal benefits may continue to be processed, but with backlogs\n* Active military members would continue to be paid, but veterans' benefits could run out if a shutdown lasts more than a few weeks\n* National parks and monuments would be closed\n* Passport and visa applications would be delayed\n* Clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health would be halted\n* Courts would operate for two weeks, but with serious disruptions\n\n**Local Governments Prepare for a Shutdown**\n\nLocal governments in the Washington region are preparing for a shutdown by setting aside pots of money in anticipation of lost revenue.

            "ground_truth": "Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\"",

The spacecraft, set to launch in July 2018, will venture closer to the sun than any previous mission, within 3.7 million miles of its surface. This historic mission aims to unlock the secrets of the sun's corona, solar wind, and space weather, which can impact Earth's power grid, satellites, and astronauts.\n\n**The Mission's Objectives**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will:\n\n1. **Tracing the flow of energy** that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind.\n2. **Determine the structure and dynamics** of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind.\n3. **Explore mechanisms** that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\n\n**The Spacecraft's Design**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield, which will protect the spacecraft from temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit while keeping the science instruments at room temperature. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to maintain a safe temperature.\n\n**The Science Behind the Mission**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will study the sun's corona, which is hotter than its surface, and the solar wind, which can impact Earth's power grid and satellites. The mission will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\n**The Importance of the Mission**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a groundbreaking mission that will revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its impact on our planet. The findings from this mission will have significant implications for space weather forecasting, satellite operations, and the protection of Earth's power grid.\n\n**Eugene Parker's Legacy**\n\nEugene Parker, the mission's namesake, is a renowned astrophysicist who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. His work has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system. Parker will be honored with a plate on the spacecraft, which will carry a message to the sun.\n\n**The Mission's Timeline**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is scheduled to launch in July 2018 and will make 24 close flybys of the sun over the next seven years.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge.",

The breaches, which occurred during the holiday season, have raised concerns about the security of consumer data and the sophistication of cyber attacks.\n\n**Neiman Marcus Breach**\n\nNeiman Marcus disclosed that its computer network was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, with the breach not fully contained until January 1. The company revealed that some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at its stores, but assured that Social Security numbers and birth dates were not compromised. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner, citing a need to confirm evidence before notifying customers. The company has offered one free year of credit monitoring to affected customers.\n\n**Target Breach**\n\nTarget's data breach, which was first reported in December, affected over 100 million customers, with 40 million credit and debit card numbers stolen, along with encrypted PINs for debit cards. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight, obtained by NBC News, provides new insight into the breach, detailing the type of malware used and the regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off the attack. The report notes that the malware was effective and innovative, with the intrusion operators displaying a high degree of skill in orchestrating the breach.\n\n**International Hacking Campaign**\n\nA report prepared by federal and private investigators suggests that the Target breach was part of a broader and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report, sent to financial-services companies and retailers, offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack.\n\n**Common Threads**\n\nBoth breaches appear to have been committed by criminal groups in Eastern Europe, with the malware used in the Target breach similar to that used in the Neiman Marcus breach. The report notes that the tactic used during the Target holiday hackers is \"new to eCrime\" and \"covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.\" This style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, leading experts to expect more of this type of breach in the future.\n\n**Investigations**\n\nA growing group of state attorneys general, including those from Connecticut, New York, and Illinois, are jointly investigating both the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches, examining whether the two attacks are related.

Yesterday, iSight released its own report, saying that a virus it's calling KAPTOXA \"has potentially infected a large number of retail information systems\"—and noting that the \"intrusion operators displayed innovation and a high degree of skill,\" particularly in terms of the \"operational sophistication\" of the hack. The Journal shares this feature by way of example: The virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a Target server that the hackers later accessed. The virus attacks point-of-sale systems in a way that is \"new to eCrime,\" subverting traditional efforts to protect consumer data, the report warns, according to NBC. Parts of the code, which is impervious to all known antivirus software, have been online since last spring. It's partly in Russian, which US officials think may indicate a link to organized crime in the former Soviet Union. The finding follows reports of similar breaches at Neiman Marcus.

The lion had escaped from the park and was surrounded by hundreds of bystanders, who were taking selfies with the animal. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said that the rangers had no choice but to shoot the lion as a last resort to save lives, as the animal was agitated by the noise and commotion from the crowd.\n\nMohawk was a well-known and beloved lion, often seen with lionesses in the park. The incident sparked an outcry among Kenyans, with many asking why the rangers did not tranquilize the lion instead. The KWS has said that it is unsure why there is a surge in lion escapes, but conservationists cite habitat loss as the central reason.\n\nThe Nairobi National Park has had several lion escapes in recent weeks, with all but Mohawk being recaptured alive. The park is home to leopards, buffaloes, giraffes, and other animals, and is largely bounded by an electric fence to keep animals inside. However, its south side is bordered by a river, which may be the path the lions use to sneak out.\n\n**South Africa**\n\nIn South Africa, a 3-year-old male lion named Sylvester has escaped from Karoo National Park and is being hunted by wildlife officials. The lion has a satellite tracking collar and has been known to be a troublesome animal, having escaped from the park before and killed several animals. The South African National Parks has said that they will put the lion down if it poses a threat to humans.\n\nThe incident has sparked a Twitter hashtag #SaveSylvester and an online petition to rescue the big cat. Conservationists have a reason to try and save the king of the jungle, as the African lion is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\n**Global Context**\n\nThe incidents in Kenya and South Africa highlight the complex balance between protecting people and conserving lions.

Mohawk, a 13-year-old lion who was one of Nairobi National Park's most well-known creatures due to his trademark mane and rep as somewhat of a \"ladies' lion,\" had escaped from an unfenced section of the park and ended up in the town of Isinya, where he was promptly surrounded by a jeering group of men, the Washington Post reports. Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN. A bunch of lions have busted out of the park lately, driven by what conservationists say is the noise from development projects, including a highway being built through the park.

The relic, a tiny lead tube measuring less than an inch long, is dated to the 6th century C.E. and is believed to have been brought back from the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus, Turkey, by a pilgrim.\n\nThe discovery was made during excavations of the ancient and medieval port of Burgos (also known as Poros) on Cape Foros in the Bulgarian city of Burgas. The site, which was first excavated in 2008, has yielded a wealth of artifacts and buildings dating back to the 4th-6th century AD. The lead tube reliquary is considered one of the most important discoveries in the history of the Burgas Regional Museum of History.\n\nAccording to Milen Nikolov, director of the museum, early Christians believed that the relic had healing properties, and pilgrims would collect a holy curing powder, known as manna, from the site of John the Apostle's grave.

The team found a small lead container with ashes while excavating a basilica that dates back to the sixth century AD, reports Archaeology in Bulgaria. The markings on the inch-long vessel match those at the grave of St. John the Apostle in what is now Turkey, leading researchers to surmise that a long-ago Christian from Bulgaria traveled to the grave site and returned home with the sample of ashes. Such journeys were common around that time, reports Novinite. “Probably a pilgrim from the Foros Peninsula went on a pilgrimage to Ephesus, and came back here with this relic, which was then donated to the basilica on Foros,” says the director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History in Bulgaria.

The new policy allows new parents to take off as much time as they want during the first year after a child's birth or adoption, with the option to return to work on a full- or part-time basis.\n\nAccording to Netflix's Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, the company wants to foster a \"freedom and responsibility\" culture that gives employees the flexibility and confidence to balance their work and family life. The policy is designed to eliminate the stress and financial burden associated with taking time off, allowing employees to focus on their families without worrying about work.\n\nUnder the new policy, Netflix employees will continue to receive their normal pay while on leave, eliminating the need to switch to state or disability pay. The company believes that this policy will help employees return to work more focused and dedicated, leading to better performance and productivity.\n\nThis move is seen as a significant perk in the tech industry, where companies are increasingly competing for top talent. Netflix's policy is similar to those offered by other tech giants, such as Facebook and Google, which have also doubled their maternity and paternity leave policies in recent years.\n\nWhile the policy has been praised for its flexibility and generosity, some experts have noted that unlimited time off policies can have their pitfalls. Extended absences can strain workplace relations and require employees to work with their managers and teams ahead of time to ensure that their absence won't jeopardize a project or deadline.\n\nOverall, Netflix's new policy is seen as a bold move to attract and retain top talent in the tech industry, and a testament to the company's commitment to work-life balance and employee well-being.",

The new policy \"deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers,\" reports Fortune, \"as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging.\" It's a \"landmark perk,\" reports TechCrunch, noting that Yahoo doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013 (to 16 paid weeks for moms and eight paid weeks for dads) to compete with packages offered by Facebook and Google because \"the talent is growing up.\" A decade ago big company perks included free lunch and ping pong tables, but now the major moves are about helping employees balance work and home life because \"experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home,\" Cranz adds. Of course, employees will have to plan their leave with managers and coworkers in advance to make sure their absence isn't disruptive—behaving, you know, like adults.

A new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that people with coronary artery disease who experience large fluctuations in weight are at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nThe study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, occurs when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. Cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy weight to prevent and treat coronary artery disease. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"We need to be concerned about weight fluctuation in this group that is already at high risk due to coronary disease.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further. (Yo-yo dieting is bad for women's hearts in general.)",

According to the autopsy report, the likely cause of her death was the combination of sedatives and local anesthesia administered during the procedure.\n\nFinley, who was previously healthy, was taken to Dr. Lilly Geyer's office at Island Dentistry for Children on December 3, 2013, for a dental procedure that included cavity fillings and root canals. During the procedure, she was given five different drugs, including Demerol, hydroxyzine, and chlorohydrate, as well as laughing gas and an injection of local anesthetic. Immediately after the lidocaine injection, Finley became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\nThe autopsy report, conducted by Honolulu Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Christopher Happy, concluded that the sedatives and local anesthesia were the probable cause of Finley's death, classifying it as an accident. The report also noted that Finley's teeth were in good shape, with no signs of underlying heart problems or allergic reactions to the medications.\n\nFinley's parents, Ashley and Evan Boyle, filed a negligence lawsuit against Dr. Geyer and her office, alleging that their daughter was not properly monitored while sedated. According to the lawsuit, Finley was not checked for oxygen levels for 26 minutes, and no one administered CPR when she went into cardiac arrest. The family's attorney, Rick Fried, stated that the allegations are \"unproven\" but declined to comment further due to the ongoing lawsuit.\n\nDr. Geyer's attorney, John Nishimoto, also declined to comment on the autopsy report, citing the lawsuit. However, it was reported that Dr. Geyer had a clean record with the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, with no complaints filed against her or her practice.\n\nIn response to the incident, new state rules took effect in January 2014, tightening oversight of dental sedation in Hawaii. The incident serves as a tragic reminder of the importance of proper monitoring and safety protocols in medical procedures, particularly those involving sedation.\n\nNo criminal charges have been brought against Dr. Geyer in connection with Finley's death. The case highlights the need for vigilance and accountability in the medical profession to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.",

Simpson, now 70, appeared before the board and apologized for his role in the 2007 crime, stating that he had \"done my time\" and was a model prisoner.\n\nSimpson's parole hearing drew significant media attention, with many comparing it to his highly publicized murder trial in 1995, in which he was acquitted of killing his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The trial was a major cultural phenomenon, and its themes of racial bias, celebrity, and domestic violence remain relevant today.\n\nDuring the hearing, Simpson claimed that he had been misled by associates and had no intent to commit a crime. However, one of his associates, Tom Riccio, disputed this account, stating that Simpson had orchestrated the robbery and had done more than just take his call.\n\nDespite this controversy, the parole board voted unanimously to grant Simpson parole, with board member Tony Corda describing him as a \"low risk to reoffend.\" Simpson is expected to be released as early as October and plans to move to his home in Florida.\n\n**Internet Archive Efforts to Preserve Web Pages**\n\nIn other news, the Internet Archive is working to preserve web pages and fix broken links on the web.

If so, he's expected to be out on Oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including CNN. Per CNN, one of the first questions posed to Simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a Vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \"What were you thinking?\" Simpson called it a \"big mistake\" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \"I would never pull a gun on anybody.\" He insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \"behind me,\" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing. Other Simpson quotes: \"I'm at a point in my life where all I want to do is spend as much time with my children.\" \"I've basically spent a conflict-free life.\" Daughter Arnelle Simpson said her father is \"remorseful,\" and she wants him to come home so they can \"move forward,\" adding, \"It's been hard.\"",

The conference was marked by a mix of tense exchanges with reporters, humorous moments, and a series of claims and counter-claims about his administration's performance.\n\nTrump began the conference by announcing his new nominee for Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, and touting his poll numbers. He then turned to the topic of the media, accusing CNN of having \"anger and hatred\" in its reporting and saying that he no longer watches the network. Trump also criticized the media for being \"dishonest\" and \"out of control,\" and claimed that the public no longer believes the press.\n\nThe conference was marked by a series of contentious exchanges between Trump and reporters, including CNN's Jim Acosta, who pressed Trump on the topic of his campaign's ties to Russia. Trump denied any wrongdoing and accused the media of perpetuating \"fake news\" about his administration.\n\nTrump also addressed the topic of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who had resigned earlier in the week.

Trump denied any wrongdoing and accused the media of perpetuating \"fake news\" about his administration's relationships with Russia.\n\nTrump also made a series of claims about his administration's performance, including saying that he had \"inherited a mess\" from his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Smith said Trump \"owes it to the American people\" to answer legitimate questions liked the ones about Russia that he dismissed as \"fake news.\" But not all the reviews were so negative. A look at coverage: Yes, he was \"combative,\" observes Mara Liasson at NPR, \"but he was also funny and charming like he was with the press during all those years in New York as a fixture in the tabloids. ... I think that he will get a lot of credit for doing this. I think it will thrill his supporters.\" The Washington Post fact-checks what it describes as 15 \"dubious claims\" from the conference, including Trump's claim that he had the \"biggest electoral college win since Reagan.\" Trump had a total of 304 electoral college votes, which ranks sixth in the eight elections since Reagan's 525-vote 1984 landslide. Only George W. Bush won with fewer than Trump. \"I was given that information,\" Trump said when a reporter challenged him on the statement. The AP takes a close look at Trump's \"I inherited a mess line\" and decides the claim itself is messy. CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord, reacting to scathing reviews: “Lord, I think we saw two different press conferences,\" he said, per Raw Story. \"From my perspective, I thought he was relaxed, he was funny, he was on point. He took the whole issue of the media, and he had a very candid conversation.\" Politico has an exhaustive list of the topics Trump covered during the 77-minute presser, ranging from nuclear holocaust to CNN, which he downgraded from \"fake news\" to \"very fake news.\" BuzzFeed has video of one of the conference's most heavily commented upon moments: when Trump asked a black reporter if she could set up a meeting between him and the Congressional Black Caucus. Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. \"It was bizarre theater,\" says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump's performance. \"You can't say he's not responsive to the press,\" she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.\" Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper's description of the press conference as \"wild\" and \"unhinged,\" including Trump's claim that \"the leaks are real\" but \"the news is fake.\" Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. \"My guess is he did it because he's mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam,\" Jimmy Kimmel said. \"The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress.\" David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?",

On Wednesday, a pump on one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down after hitting a temperature limit. This forced NASA to reroute coolant into Loop-B, causing the crew to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments.\n\nAccording to NASA, the situation does not represent a life-threatening emergency, and the crew was never in any danger. However, the problem has required a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost. Engineers suspect a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant may have caused the issue.\n\nMission managers are trying to determine whether a software fix can get the valve working again or whether a spacewalk will be required. Sorting through all the issues might take a couple of days or as much as a couple of weeks. Routine maintenance for \"Big 14\" repair operations typically takes two weeks to plan, but this depends on the resources at hand and the urgency of the problem.\n\nThe ISS has been continuously occupied since 2000 by spacefliers who spend tours of duty lasting four to six months. The current plan calls for the space station to be maintained through 2020, although the United States and the 14 other countries supporting the $100 billion-plus station project are already considering extending its operating life.\n\nThe six-person crew on board the ISS consists of NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins and Rick Mastracchio, Russians Mikhail Tyurin, Sergey Ryazanskiy, and Oleg Kotov, and Koichi Wakata of Japan. The current mission, officially called Expedition 38, is scheduled to go until March 2014.\n\nNASA has scaled back operations on the ISS, shutting down some non-critical systems, including those in the Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab. The space station's life support system is still up and running. Officials may decide to perform an emergency spacewalk to fix the failed pump, but a decision has not been made yet, and it may take a couple of days to determine the best course of action.\n\nThe ISS has faced similar issues in the past, with spacewalkers dealing with coolant system maintenance issues in 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2007.

His bulletin, which was titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" predicted that \"MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS. PERHAPS LONGER.\" The document also warned of \"WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS.\"\n\nRicks, who was the forecast coordinator for the Slidell, Louisiana, office at the time, has said that he was awestruck by the severity of the storm and the potential consequences. He has also stated that he would rather have been wrong in his prediction, but his local expertise and experience with previous storms led him to believe that the storm would be catastrophic.\n\n**The Response**\n\nDespite the warning, many people in the affected areas did not evacuate, and the response to the storm was slow and inadequate. Ricks has said that the response broke his heart, as he had done everything in his power to warn people of the monster storm that was coming.\n\n**Legacy of the Storm**\n\nThe legacy of Hurricane Katrina is still felt today. The storm led to a major overhaul of the National Weather Service's forecasting procedures, with a focus on issuing more dire and effective warnings during true weather emergencies. Meteorologists like Gary Szatkowski, who issued a personal plea during Hurricane Sandy's landfall in 2012, have been praised for their efforts to increase the effectiveness of government bulletins.\n\nRicks' bulletin, which is now on display at the Smithsonian Museum of American History, is considered one of the most effective and dire weather forecasts ever issued by the National Weather Service. It serves as a reminder of the importance of accurate and timely warnings during severe weather events.\n\n**Remembering the Storm**\n\nAs the city of New Orleans continues to rebuild and recover from the storm, it is essential to remember the lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina.

As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public.

Many users, including Imani Gandy, a senior legal analyst, face constant abuse on the platform due to their race, gender, and medical conditions. Gandy has reported the abuse to Twitter, but the company has failed to take adequate action.\n\nTwitter's current system for reporting abuse is limited, and users often find it difficult to get help. The company's \"Report Abuse\" button is not effective in stopping persistent attackers, who can create new accounts to continue their harassment. Some users have even reported that Twitter has allowed accounts to remain active despite violating its community rules.\n\nExperts, including Soraya Chemaly, a media critic and feminist activist, are calling on Twitter to take more robust action to protect its users from harassment. Chemaly suggests that Twitter could learn from third-party software like \"Block Together,\" which allows users to automatically block new accounts that send them direct messages.\n\nTwitter's commitment to free expression may be clouding its judgment on this issue, Chemaly argues.

The country's sixth nuclear test, conducted on Sunday, has sparked widespread condemnation from the global community. According to seismological data, the test was the most powerful ever detonated by North Korea, with nuclear experts suggesting that the warhead could be paired with a long-range missile capable of striking the United States.\n\nSouth Korean lawmakers have reported that North Korea is believed to be moving an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with some speculating that the country may test-fire the missile towards the North Pacific at a lower angle than previous tests. This has led to a significant increase in military activity in the region, with South Korea conducting live-fire drills off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe international community has responded to North Korea's nuclear test with a unified front. The United Nations has condemned the test, with Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the UN, calling for the strongest sanctions measures possible to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. China's leader, Xi Jinping, has also urged for global peace and called on North Korea to stop nuclear tests.\n\nHowever, despite the united front, there are signs of a rift between South Korea and the United States. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, have agreed to lift current restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles, but Trump has also criticized South Korea for \"appeasement\" when it comes to dealing with its northern neighbor.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear program has been a long-standing concern, and the country's recent tests have sparked fears of a potential conflict in the region. The country's founding day, celebrated on September 9, may also see another missile test, with some experts predicting that an ICBM test could occur on this date.\n\nThe situation remains volatile, with North Korea's nuclear program continuing to pose a significant threat to regional and global security.

Things get pretty vague beyond that: He didn't know the method of transport or when the movement was noticed. But Reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts, via an unnamed source quoted by South Korea’s Asia Business Daily. Its source says the ICBM started moving Monday, is only being moved at night, and is headed toward the nation's west coast. Reuters notes there's some likelihood that another test could come on or around Saturday: Sept. 9 is the country's founding day holiday. CNBC notes North Korea conducted a nuke test on Sept. 9, 2016. Two more details that allegedly came from the South's National Intelligence Service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the North's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next ICBM test firing might be directed toward the North Pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the White House tells Reuters it has given \"in-principle approval\" to a request by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights, a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the North, if necessary. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin on Tuesday gave his take on the situation: North Korea \"will eat grass but will not give up the (nuclear) program if they don't feel safe.\"",

When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham.

This shift in demographics has significant implications for the medical community, as younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer, but also tend to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Cancer, researchers analyzed data from nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that 37,847 patients, or approximately 15 percent, were under the age of 50. These younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and were more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy than older patients.\n\nDespite the increased risk of advanced cancer, younger patients tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence. The five-year survival rates for patients under 50 were 95.1 percent for localized disease, 76 percent for regional disease, and 21.3 percent for distant disease, compared to 91.9 percent, 70.3 percent, and 14.1 percent, respectively, for older patients.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unclear, but experts suggest that environmental factors, such as smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity, may be contributing to the trend. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted that \"it's not simply a change in diagnoses, it's a very real increase.\"\n\nThe findings of this study raise important questions about the current guidelines for colon cancer screening. While some experts argue that the data do not support expanding screening to younger age groups, others suggest that the medical community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\n\nIn light of these findings, it is essential for doctors to be aware of the warning signs of colon cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon. People with a family history of colon cancer and those who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50. Ultimately, further research is needed to understand the causes of this trend and to determine the best course of action for preventing and treating colon cancer in younger adults.\n\n**Key Statistics",
            "ground_truth": "A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, is located in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide. The discovery was made by chance when a colleague needed to use the restroom, and the area was surveyed with an Aboriginal elder.\n\n**Significance of the Discovery**\n\nThe site is crucial in understanding human settlement in Australia, and the age of the site is significant. The previous oldest-known site in the arid zone, located at Puritjarra in western Central Australia, is around 38,000 years old. This discovery pushes back the earliest-known dates on the development of key bone and stone axe technologies and the use of ochre in Australia.\n\n**Evidence of Human Interaction with Megafauna**\n\nThe site also contains evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a marsupial measuring 2m in height and weighing more than 2,500kg. The presence of bones from juvenile animals in a cave on a cliff suggests they were hunted. This discovery is significant in the debate over the extinction of megafauna, as it suggests that humans may have played a role in their extinction.\n\n**Dating of the Site**\n\nThe age of the site was determined through a combination of optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon dating of hearth charcoal and eggshell samples. The results indicate that humans occupied the site from 49,000 to 46,000 years ago.\n\n**Implications of the Discovery**\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of human settlement in Australia. It suggests that humans were able to migrate south quickly, and that they had developed complex technologies and social structures. The discovery also challenges the Eurocentric view that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world.\n\n**Future Research**\n\nThe site will continue to be excavated, and further research will be conducted to learn more about the lives of the people who lived there. The discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter is a significant milestone in the study of human settlement in Australia, and it will continue to be an important site for researchers in the years to come.\n\n**Quotes from Researchers**\n\n* \"The old idea is that people might have come from the East, from the Levant, out of Africa, and these modern humans may have come with a package of innovative technologies.",
            "ground_truth": "\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News. Hamm was surveying a section of Australia's Flinders Ranges when his partner, aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard, had to go to the bathroom. \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Hamm says. At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed. (Ninety rocks in Australia could rank up there with Stonehenge.)",

However, this has led to awkward and unentertaining conversations, with some deejays even having their taped segments pulled. Additionally, there have been rumors that Britney will lip-sync during her Vegas show, which she has denied. Furthermore, before-and-after images of her \"Work Bitch\" video have surfaced, suggesting that she may have used visual effects to slim down.\n\nBritney's father, Jamie Spears, has been overseeing her life and career since 2008, when a court ruled that she was not fit to manage herself. He has been paid $16,000 per month for his duties, but is now asking for more money, including an additional $800 per month for his office rent and $2,000 per month for office space.\n\n**Martha Stewart**\n\nMartha Stewart was seen at the American Made Awards, where she discussed her dating life and said that she's just waiting for the right guy to scoop her up. She also revealed that she gets nauseous when she's in a dirty house.\n\n**Beyoncé**\n\nBeyoncé posted a photo of herself and Blue Ivy on Instagram, but with their faces hidden. She's currently on her \"Mrs. Carter\" tour, which will come to a close on December 22.\n\n**Charlie Hunnam**\n\nCharlie Hunnam has been skipping scheduled appearances to avoid questions about his decision to pull out of the movie \"50 Shades of Grey.\" His co-stars have also been instructed not to answer any questions about him or the movie.\n\n**Other Celebrity News**\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was spotted eating at two different restaurants in New York City, including Buca di Beppo and Bice. Elvis Duran and Eric Trump will be walking across the Brooklyn Bridge to raise awareness for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's fight against pediatric cancer. The Off-Broadway parody \"Bayside!

I continue to have significant oversight duties relating to her visitation with her children,\" he writes in a new petition to the court. In addition to the $16,000 he gets for those duties per month, he also gets $1,200 for office rent, and he wants that amount bumped to $2,000, plus $7,200 in back pay for the increased rent he's paid since last year. Brit is apparently also under strict control when it comes to interviews. She's been promoting her upcoming Vegas residency, and her handlers told radio interviewers that during the five-minute interviews, they could only ask about Vegas or Britney's new album or single, sources tell the New York Daily News. \"So everyone is clear,\" the stations are being informed, \"no personal questions and no funny business.\" But apparently the interviews still aren't going well: One was pulled entirely after DJs deemed it \"a one-sided conversation,\" and during another, the hosts needed to ask a distracted Spears one of their questions twice.",

They can be purchased on Spectacles.com, and shipping is expected to take two to four weeks.

In its SEC filing, the company admitted that Spectacles have not generated significant revenue, and production and operating costs are expected to exceed related revenue in the near future.\n\nHowever, Snap believes that making Spectacles more widely available will help the company to increase its user base and encourage more people to create and watch Snaps.

The fraternity the men claim to be part of, Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT), has released a statement denying any affiliation with the group.\n\nAccording to ZBT, the men were not part of the Epsilon Gamma Chapter, which is recognized by the university and the national fraternity. Instead, they were a separate group that used the ZBT name without authorization. ZBT has retained legal counsel and plans to sue the men for falsely representing themselves and damaging the fraternity's reputation.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the men's unauthorized use of the ZBT name, symbols, and materials is a violation of United States Copyright and Trademark law.

The national fraternity says its intellectual property—including its name, the ZBT initials, and other materials—are protected under copyright rules, WRGB reports. That means anyone who falsely claims to be affiliated with the frat is fair game for legal action, a move the attorney for one of the accused says he's baffled by. \"It's certainly novel, and I'm not sure why they'd take that step,\" the lawyer for Joseph Angilletta, one of two men arrested just last week in the case, tells the station. \"Clearly one aspect here is they seem to want to distance themselves from this tragic event.\" (Five Baruch College frat members may face up to 20 years behind bars for allegedly taking part in the \"glass ceiling.\")",

This sets the stage for the events that unfold in the film, including a police raid on an unlicensed nightclub that sparks a riot and the subsequent occupation of the Algiers Motel by police.\n\nThe film's centerpiece is the harrowing and quite long depiction of the police occupation of the Algiers, which is a nauseating and revolting sequence of events. The film also depicts the trial of the three officers, which is a tense and emotionally charged sequence that highlights the inherent racism of the justice system.\n\nWhile some critics have praised the film for its unflinching portrayal of police brutality, others have criticized it for being too passive in its condemnation of the misconduct it depicts. However, the film's director, Kathryn Bigelow, has stated that she does not think it is up to the filmmaker to judge, and that the film is meant to be a historical reenactment rather than a judgment.\n\nThe film has been praised for its performances, particularly from John Boyega, who plays a private security guard who is called in to protect a store near the Algiers from looters. The film has also been praised for its cinematography and editing, which create a visceral and immersive experience for the viewer.\n\nOverall, \"Detroit\" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that is sure to spark important conversations about police brutality and systemic oppression. While it may not be an easy watch, it is a necessary one, and it is a testament to the enduring power of cinema to tell important stories and to challenge our assumptions about the world around us.\n\nThe film has received widespread critical acclaim, with a Tomatometer score of 93% based on the opinions of hundreds of film and television critics.

But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point.\" Chris Klimek says Detroit is \"maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,\" citing \"lightly fictionalized\" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \"for maximum outrage.\" This is \"messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,\" he writes at NPR.

Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film \"tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people.\" But Detroit still makes for \"urgent viewing,\" he writes at the Toronto Star.

The board members, including Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice, and James Murdoch, stated that Musk \"opened a discussion\" about taking the company private last week, which included discussions on how being private could better serve Tesla's long-term interests and addressed the funding for the takeover.\n\nHowever, the board's statement has raised several questions, including the timing of the announcement, the method of disclosure, and the funding for the takeover. Musk's tweet, which stated that he had \"funding secured\" for the deal, has been criticized for being irregular and potentially misleading.\n\nRegulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are likely to investigate the matter further, particularly with regards to Musk's claim that funding was secured. The SEC has already inquired about the issue, and experts have raised concerns about the structure of the deal and the potential for Tesla to remain a public entity despite the takeover.\n\nMusk's motivation for taking the company private is also unclear, with some speculating that he may be trying to influence the stock price or avoid the quarterly earnings cycle. The company's cash-flow negative status has also raised concerns about the feasibility of the takeover.\n\nTesla's stock price has fluctuated wildly since the announcement, with shares surging to a peak of $368 before trading was halted.

A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the idea of Nikolai Kardashev's three phases of galactic expansion, also known as the three \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations.\n\n**The Three Types of Civilizations**\n\nKardashev's model proposes that civilizations progress through three stages:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet, which is where humanity currently stands, with a rating of 0.7 on the scale.\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the radiation of a star, which humans might achieve in a few thousand years.\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing all the resources of a galaxy, which would require a civilization to expand throughout the universe, securing as many stars as possible before they become inaccessible.\n\n**The Challenge of Dark Energy**\n\nHowever, the presence of dark energy in the universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, making it increasingly difficult for civilizations to access energy from distant stars. According to Hooper, the stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon in approximately 100 billion years, making them unobservable and inaccessible.\n\n**The Solution: Dyson Spheres**\n\nTo overcome this challenge, advanced civilizations might employ Dyson spheres, a swarm of satellites that can harness the energy of a star. This concept was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960 and has since been explored in science fiction. Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, which would hover in space, collecting energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\n**Detecting Advanced Civilizations**\n\nHooper suggests that astronomers could detect the presence of advanced civilizations by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away. These signatures would be dominated by massive stars and would peak at longer wavelengths than usual.\n\n**The Search for Alien Civilizations**\n\nWhile we may not have the technology to detect these signatures yet, the search for advanced alien civilizations continues. By understanding the challenges of energy harvesting and the potential solutions, we may one day be able to identify signs of intelligent life beyond our planet.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe quest for energy is a universal challenge that has been explored by scientists and science fiction authors alike.

            "ground_truth": "Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it.",

The infection led to stage 3 kidney reflux, which has resulted in her left kidney having only 22% functionality.\n\nRecently, Oakleigh was diagnosed with a critical case of E. coli, a \"super strain\" that can cause severe complications, including cardiac arrest. Her family is concerned that the E. coli strain is resistant to many antibiotics, making treatment challenging.\n\nTo address the kidney reflux, Oakleigh is scheduled for surgery at the end of this month, which will involve repairing her left kidney and removing a pocket on the outside of the kidney. After the surgery, she will meet with a cardiologist to discuss additional testing for her heart condition, which includes moderate ASD and pulmonary stenosis.\n\nOakleigh's family is relying on their faith to get them through this difficult time. They are also trying to raise money through a GoFundMe account to cover medical expenses, including the upcoming surgery.\n\n**Understanding Pseudomonas Infections**\n\nPseudomonas infections are caused by a common type of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While healthy people often carry these bacteria without issues, they can cause serious infections in people who are weak or ill. Pseudomonas infections are hard to treat due to the bacteria's resistance to many antibiotics.\n\nSymptoms of Pseudomonas infections depend on the location of the infection, but can include fever, fatigue, and green-blue pus in wounds. In severe cases, the infection can spread through the bloodstream, causing septicemia, which can lead to high fever, chills, confusion, and shock.\n\n**Similar Cases**\n\nA recent case in Oklahoma City involved an infant who contracted a \"super strain\" of E. coli, which is similar to Oakleigh's situation.

Stewart's vision for the show was to make it more pointed, purposeful, and intentional, focusing on the absurdity of politics and the media.\n\nInitially, Stewart faced resistance from the existing writing staff, who were accustomed to the show's previous format. However, with the help of new head writer Ben Karlin, Stewart was able to bring a fresh perspective to the show. Karlin's arrival marked a turning point for The Daily Show, as he brought a higher quotient of righteous anger to the show's jokes and a focus on more newsworthy topics.\n\nThe show's correspondents, including Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and Mo Rocca, played a crucial role in shaping the show's tone and point of view. They developed characters that were both humorous and satirical, often targeting politicians and the media. The show's field pieces, which initially featured obscure eccentrics, began to focus on more mainstream targets, including politicians and their staff.\n\nA breakthrough moment for the show came in December 1999, when Steve Carell asked Senator John McCain a question on his bus that forced the politician to go off-book. This moment marked a shift in the show's approach, as it began to focus on deconstructing the process of politics and the media, rather than just making jokes.\n\nUnder Stewart's leadership, The Daily Show became a cultural touchstone, known for its biting satire and insightful commentary on politics and the media. The show's success can be attributed to its ability to balance humor and intelligence, making it a must-watch for a generation of viewers.\n\nKey figures in the show's evolution include:\n\n* Jon Stewart: Host and driving force behind the show's transformation\n* Ben Karlin: Head writer who brought a fresh perspective to the show\n* Stephen Colbert: Correspondent who developed a satirical character and became a key player in the show's success\n* Steve Carell: Correspondent who asked the question that forced Senator John McCain to go off-book\n* Mo Rocca: Correspondent who developed a humorous and satirical character\n\nThe Daily Show's evolution is a testament to the power of satire and the importance of challenging the status quo.

Jason Barbour, the director of the Johnston County Emergency 911 Communications Center, praised Medlin's quick thinking and resourcefulness, saying that it was a prime example of technology being used to the fullest at someone's greatest time of need.\n\nMattevi was released on a $10,000 bond, and the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of domestic violence awareness and the need for victims to seek help.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n* Date: January 14, 2017\n* Time: 4 a.m.\n* Location: Johnston County, North Carolina\n* Victim: 29-year-old woman\n* Suspect: Nicholas Mattevi, 32-year-old boyfriend\n* Charges: False imprisonment\n* Outcome: Woman rescued, suspect arrested and charged",
            "ground_truth": "A North Carolina woman allegedly locked in the trunk of a moving car by her boyfriend was saved by a quick-thinking 911 dispatcher and a lowly flip phone, ABC News reports. The 29-year-old woman called 911 around 4am Jan. 14. The woman had gotten in a fight with her boyfriend, who was \"jealous,\" according to WRAL. Before dispatcher Tim Medlin could get much information from the woman, the call was dropped. He was unable to get her to answer when he called back. Then Medlin remembered a flip phone the 911 communications center keeps around in case the phone lines go down, WTVD reports. He says texting was the only way he could think to contact her without getting \"her in trouble.\" The woman texted Medlin back, letting the dispatcher know she was in a red Mustang headed toward Fayetteville. Verizon provided the location of the woman's phone, and police stopped her and her boyfriend, Nicholas Mattevi, in Fayetteville. Mattevi, 32, was arrested and charged with false imprisonment. \"I can go to bed,\" Medlin recalls feeling upon hearing of the arrest. \"We've done our job.\" He says he's planning to buy a smartphone for the office to replace the old flip phone and make it easier to text if there's a next time. Medlin's boss tells ABC the dispatcher \"really stood by our motto: Failure is not an option.\" (This 911 dispatcher was accused of hanging up on callers.)",

The majority of her estate was split among her three children, including her son Sam Robards, who was tasked with caring for her beloved dog Sophie. Bacall bequeathed $10,000 to Sam to cover the costs of Sophie's care, ensuring the papillon would continue to live a comfortable life.\n\nIn addition to the bequest for Sophie, Bacall's will also included provisions for her employees, with Maria Santos receiving $20,000 and Ilsa Hernandez, a Honduran immigrant who worked as Bacall's maid for 14 years, receiving $15,000. Bacall's grandsons, Calvin Robards and Sebastian Robards, were each left $250,000, which was intended to be used for college expenses.\n\nBacall's estate also included her co-op apartment in the Dakota building, royalties, and personal property. The remainder of a trust left to her by her late husband, Humphrey Bogart, was also included in the estate. Bacall's children, Sam, Stephen Humphrey Bogart, and Leslie Bogart, were named as the executors of her estate and were tasked with auctioning off her artwork this fall.\n\nIn a request included in her will, Bacall asked her children to keep certain personal letters, writings, and diaries private. This request reflects Bacall's desire to maintain her personal life and legacy outside of the public eye.\n\nBacall's life was marked by her iconic film career, which spanned over eight decades and included two Tony Awards, a Golden Globe, and an honorary Oscar.

And two of her employees also received $20,000 and $15,000, respectively. Considering other famous four-legged heirs, Sophie's 10 grand isn't shocking: Leona Helmsley left $12 million to her Maltese and Alexander McQueen left $82,000 to his three dogs.

The couple's company, Magnolia Homes, was found to have not taken adequate precautions to protect against lead paint hazards in 33 homes in Waco, Texas, where the show was filmed.\n\nAccording to the EPA, the agency reviewed several seasons of Fixer Upper and noticed that the company was not following proper lead-safe work practices, including failing to obtain certification, assign a certified renovator, and provide homeowners with an approved pamphlet about lead-based paint hazards. The EPA also found that Magnolia did not comply with the work practice standards, such as closing doors and windows to the interior work areas and covering floor surfaces with plastic sheeting.\n\nIn addition to the fine, Magnolia has agreed to take steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects. The company will also produce a video highlighting the dangers of lead-based paint, starring Chip Gaines, and will spend $160,000 on a lead-abatement project in Waco, Texas, to reduce the risk of exposure to lead-based paint in at-risk residences.\n\nThe EPA notes that Magnolia has \"looked for ways to make a concrete difference in its local community\" and has taken steps to improve public awareness about the serious hazards of lead-based paint contained in older homes. The company has already spoken about lead-based paint on an episode of Fixer Upper and has used social media to amplify the message about lead-based paint safety.\n\nThe settlement is a significant development for the popular HGTV couple, who have built a massive following and brand through their show and other business ventures. The fine is a fraction of the maximum penalty of $556,000 that Magnolia could have faced if the case had gone to trial.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Magnolia Homes, the company behind Fixer Upper, has agreed to pay a $40,000 fine to the EPA for violating lead-paint regulations.\n* The company was found to have not taken adequate precautions to protect against lead paint hazards in 33 homes in Waco, Texas.\n* Magnolia has agreed to take steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects.\n* The company will produce a video highlighting the dangers of lead-based paint,",

Excavations at the site have uncovered evidence of technologically advanced behaviors dating back to around 320,000 years ago, challenging the long-held view that modern human behaviors emerged 40,000-50,000 years ago.\n\n**Middle Stone Age Innovations**\n\nThe discoveries include the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, which are characterized by smaller, more specialized stone tools, such as points and blades, made from obsidian and other exotic materials. The tools were likely used for specific purposes, such as hunting and gathering, and demonstrate advanced thinking and planning. The presence of obsidian and other materials from distant locations suggests the existence of long-distance trade networks and social networks among early human populations.\n\n**Climate Change and Technological Innovation**\n\nThe researchers suggest that the technological innovations at Olorgesailie were driven by climate change, which made food sources unpredictable and forced early humans to adapt and innovate. The climate in the region changed from a series of floodplains to a vast arid grassland, leading to the turnover of prey mammal species and making life difficult for early humans.\n\n**Social Networks and Exchange**\n\nThe discoveries at Olorgesailie provide evidence of early social networks and exchange, including the transportation of raw materials, such as obsidian and ochre pigment, over long distances. This suggests that early human populations were able to share information and technological skills, leading to the development of more complex societies.\n\n**Rethinking the Human Revolution**\n\nThe findings at Olorgesailie challenge the traditional view of the \"human revolution,\" which posited that modern human behaviors emerged 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that modern behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species. The relationship between complex behaviors and hominin species from 500,000 years to 160,000 years ago remains to be understood.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe discoveries at Olorgesailie have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that early human populations were capable of complex thinking and innovation, and that social networks and exchange played a key role in the development of more complex societies. The findings also highlight the importance of considering the African archaeological record in the context of human evolution, rather than relying on Eurocentric views of human history.",
            "ground_truth": "For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)",

In a rare sit-down interview with Chuck Todd on NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said, \"I have to say, no matter what you do, you're gonna have problems. Because you have sick people. They happen to be intelligent. And, you know, they can be sick as hell and they're geniuses in a certain way.\"\n\n**Gun-Free Zones**\n\nTrump has also criticized \"gun-free zones,\" stating that the Oregon shootings could have been limited if instructors or students had been armed. He argued that such zones are \"routine\" and that the conversation surrounding gun violence has become \"numb.\"\n\n**Tax Plan and Poll Numbers**\n\nIn the same interview, Trump defended his newly introduced tax plan, which independent economists estimate will cost $12tn over 10 years. He claimed that his ability to cut costs would allow him to build better roads for a fraction of the cost. Trump also pushed back against those who have said he himself would save a significant amount of money under his tax plan, stating that the major tax cut in his plan would hurt him financially.\n\n**Poll Numbers and General Election Matchups**\n\nTrump has been criticized for his poll numbers in general election matchups against Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.

He is 53 million dollars in debt and it doesn't look like he's going to get Mark Zuckerberg's help that he desperately needs,\" Piatt writes. \"We must open our hearts and wallets for Kanye today. Sure he is personally rich and can buy furs and houses for his family, but without our help, the true genius of Kanye West can't be realized.\" So far, after just a single day of fundraising, $603 has been raised for Kanye (along with a lot of comments like, \"How about you get a job?\"). Piatt tells Mashable that he's spoken to GoFundMe, and only Kanye or his team will be able to access any money raised. As for Zuckerberg—West specifically asked him, as well as Larry Page, to donate money to the Kanye cause when he went on his Twitter rant, and then went on to imply that he knows other tech giants who should help him. \"All you dudes in San Fran play rap music in your homes but never help the real artists…,\" he tweeted, followed by, \"All you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help….\" The Guardian did a little investigation into how many \"tech guys\" Kanye actually knows, and found that he really does have something of an ongoing relationship with Facebook and Apple; has had meetings with investors in Silicon Valley and even had some of them at one of his parties; has had interactions with an Instagram co-founder, the Dropbox chief executive, a co-founder of Rap Genius, and Elon Musk; and is good friends with venture capitalist Ben Horowitz.

The search area, covering approximately 217,000 square kilometers in the southern Indian Ocean, is being scoured by a fleet of vessels and aircraft equipped with advanced listening devices.\n\n**New Leads Emerge**\n\nOn Saturday, a Chinese ship, Haixun 01, picked up a pulse signal with a frequency of 37.5kHz, consistent with those emitted by the flight recorders. The signal was detected at 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, and was reportedly heard by three people on board. However, there is no confirmation yet that the signal is linked to MH370.\n\n**Australian Agency Cautious**\n\nThe head of the Australian agency co-ordinating the search, Angus Houston, said the reported signals \"are consistent with the aircraft black box\" but \"there is no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft.\"\n\n**Search Teams Scramble to Verify Signal**\n\nThe Chinese ship, Haixun 01, is not among those with special equipment to search for the black box pinger, but it is a modern search-and-rescue vessel. The search area is vast, and the range of the pinger signal, combined with the depths of water involved, make it a challenging task to detect a signal.\n\n**Racing Against Time**\n\nThe search teams are racing against time, as the battery-powered signal emitted by the data recorders fades after 30 days. Monday marks day 30 since the plane disappeared, and the search teams are working to verify the new lead before the signal disappears.\n\n**International Cooperation**\n\nThe search for MH370 has become an international effort, with ships and aircraft from Australia, China, the US, the UK, and France participating in the operation. Malaysia has set up three ministerial committees to help co-ordinate the search, and a new investigation team has been established to include members from these countries.\n\n**Experts Cautious**\n\nExperts are cautioning that the new lead should be treated with caution, as many previous leads have turned out to be false.

All the reports caution that it could turn out to be yet another false hope, however. \"This could be a variety of things,\" says one oceanographer, noting that the frequency is used by lots of instruments. For the record, the Chinese ship detected the signal at 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, says the state-run Xinhua. \"It is yet to be established whether it is related to the missing jet,\" the report says.

Trump tweeted the video with the hashtags \"#FraudNewsCNN\" and \"#FNN.\" A CNN spokesman called it \"a sad day when the president of the United States encourages violence against reporters.\" But on ABC News, Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert suggested CNN and other critics were overreacting. \"No one would perceive that as a threat,\" he said, adding that Trump is \"beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to.\" The new video comes just a few days after Trump posted two tweets in which he talked about MSNBC's Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski \"bleeding badly from a face-lift.\" Those tweets sparked condemnation from all over the political spectrum, with even Trump's fellow Republicans calling them unpresidential.

Marketing chief Phil Schiller explained the decision by stating that it was a matter of \"courage\" to move on and do something better for all users. However, this explanation was met with widespread ridicule and criticism on social media.\n\nCritics argue that the removal of the headphone jack is a step backward, as it forces users to rely on proprietary wireless technology or expensive dongles to listen to music. The decision has been compared to San Francisco's gentrification of the middle class, where the city's efforts to modernize have led to the displacement of long-time residents.\n\nSeveral experts have pointed out that there is no technological excuse for removing the headphone jack, as music does not sound better over a Lightning cable or wireless technology. In fact, wired audio is often preferred for its superior sound quality.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has also raised concerns about the impact on other devices that rely on the jack, such as Square's credit card dongle, temperature sensors, light meters, thermal imaging cameras, and personal breathalyzers.\n\nApple's decision has been seen as a move to further entrench its walled garden ecosystem, where users are forced to rely on proprietary technology and pay a premium for it. The company's mantra of \"it just works\" has been officially dead, as users are now faced with the inconvenience of using expensive dongles or wireless headphones.\n\nThe backlash against Apple's decision has been fierce, with many users expressing their outrage and frustration on social media.

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market.",

The airline has introduced a new two-lane boarding system, which aims to reduce congestion and speed up the boarding process. The new system uses color-coded lanes, with elite and priority passengers boarding through lane 1, and customers in groups 3, 4, and 5 boarding through lane 2.\n\nThe new boarding process is part of United's efforts to improve the customer experience and reduce frustration at the gate. The airline has also introduced push notifications for passengers who have the mobile app, which will alert them when boarding starts.\n\nIn addition to the new boarding process, United has expanded its routes in Latin America through a joint business agreement (JBA) with Copa and Avianca. The JBA will provide customers with more choices, including new nonstop routes, additional flights on existing routes, and reduced travel times. The agreement is expected to drive significant traffic growth at major gateway cities and create economic benefits for consumers and communities.\n\nUnited's new boarding process is similar to those introduced by American and Delta airlines in 2017. The airline has tested the new system on thousands of flights and has received positive feedback from customers and employees. However, one challenge that remains to be seen is how elite-level frequent-flyers will sort themselves out in the updated process.\n\nUnited's expansion in Latin America is a significant move for the airline, which has been working to strengthen its presence in the region.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

Vladimir Katriuk, a 93-year-old Canadian resident of Ukrainian ancestry, died last week after a long illness. Katriuk was the second-most wanted man on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list of Nazi war criminals and was accused of participating in a village massacre in Belarus during World War II.\n\nKatriuk's death comes just as Moscow was preparing a criminal case against him, which was seen as an attempt to embarrass Canada over its stance on Ukraine. The Russian government had called on Canada to extradite Katriuk to face trial for alleged war crimes, but Canada refused, citing its opposition to Russia's annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine.\n\nKatriuk's case has been a contentious issue in Canada, with Jewish groups urging his deportation and the Ukrainian Canadian Congress calling for him to be left alone. In 1999, the Federal Court ruled that Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretenses by not disclosing his collaboration with the Nazis, but found no evidence of atrocities committed by him. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke his citizenship.\n\nMeanwhile, another Nazi war criminal, Gerhard Sommer, a 93-year-old former SS officer, has been cleared of charges due to his advanced dementia. Sommer was suspected of participating in a wartime massacre of civilians in Italy, but German prosecutors have shelved their investigation due to his inability to stand trial.\n\nThe Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs has called on the Canadian government to take action on Katriuk's case, urging Ottawa to review the case and take necessary steps to ensure that if guilty, Katriuk be held accountable for war crimes committed in collaboration with the Nazi regime. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, on the other hand, has urged Ottawa to ignore Russia's demands and leave Katriuk alone.\n\nThe deaths of Katriuk and Sommer highlight the ongoing issue of Nazi war crimes and the challenges of bringing perpetrators to justice, even decades after the fact.",
            "ground_truth": "There were two men at the top of this year's Simon Wiesenthal Center most-wanted Nazi war criminal list—and there is now no chance either one will face a court. No. 2 on the list, Ukrainian-born Vladimir Katriuk, has died in Quebec at the age of 93, the Toronto Star reports. Katriuk, who moved to Canada in 1951 and worked as a beekeeper for more than 50 years, was accused of being a \"particularly active participant\" in a massacre in what is now Belarus in 1943, when he was a member of an SS battalion that allegedly carried out many atrocities, the Guardian reports. Russia charged Katriuk with genocide last month, but Canadian authorities refused a request to send him to Moscow, citing Russia's actions in Ukraine, reports the Globe and Mail. Katriuk had long been under suspicion, but the wheels of justice did not move quickly: In 1999, Canadian authorities concluded he had entered the country under false pretenses, but in 2007 a decision to cancel his citizenship was overturned due to lack of evidence, the Star reports. The man at the top of the most-wanted list is also 93 years old. Gerhard Sommer is still alive in a Hamburg-area nursing home, but German prosecutors say they've dropped their investigation because he suffers from dementia and isn't fit to stand trial, the AP reports. In 2005, he was one of 10 former SS officers an Italian court found guilty of taking part in a massacre of 560 civilians in 1944, but German law didn't permit his extradition.",

The award has also sparked controversy, with critics pointing out that Google's effective tax rate is between 2% and 3%, compared to the UK's 20% headline corporation tax rate.\n\n**Pichai's Net Worth and Comparison to Google's Founders**\n\nPichai's new shares bring his holdings in Alphabet to roughly $650 million, which is still far less than the net worth of Google's founders.

The company had initially denied Hardy's family's requests for the medication, citing concerns that it would slow down efforts to get the drug on the market. However, after a nationwide campaign and intense media attention, Chimerix relented and agreed to provide the drug, brincidofovir, for Hardy's treatment.\n\nHardy, who is currently in critical condition at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at just 9 months old. He has undergone multiple treatments and surgeries, but his condition has continued to deteriorate. The adenovirus infection he contracted after a bone marrow transplant has left him in heart and kidney failure, and his family had been desperate to find a way to save his life.\n\nChimerix's decision to provide the drug was made possible through a collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which expedited the clinical trial process. The company will now provide the drug to 20 patients in an open-label study, with Hardy being the first recipient. The FDA has also committed to working with Chimerix on the design of a pivotal Phase 3 study to further assess the drug's potential.\n\nThe campaign to save Josh Hardy's life has been a remarkable example of the power of social media and public pressure. Thousands of people took to social media to share Hardy's story and urge Chimerix to change its mind, with many organizations and charities joining in to support the family. The hashtag #savejosh trended on Twitter, and a Facebook page dedicated to the campaign attracted over 15,000 fans.\n\nWhile Chimerix's decision to provide the drug is a major victory for Hardy and his family, it also highlights the complexities and challenges of the pharmaceutical industry. The company's initial refusal to provide the drug sparked a national debate about the ethics of compassionate use and the balance between profit and patient care.\n\nIn the end, Josh Hardy's story has brought attention to the need for more clinical development and research into the treatment of adenovirus infections.

The incident, which has never been publicly reported until now, allegedly occurred during a photo shoot for the film, where Sizemore, then 42, allegedly touched the girl's genitals.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, including a dozen cast and crew members, Sizemore was sent home from the Utah set after the girl told her mother about the incident. However, months later, he returned for reshoots in Malibu after the girl's parents declined to press charges.\n\nThe girl, now 26, has recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against Sizemore as well as her parents. Sizemore's agent, Stephen Rice, has declined to comment on the matter, stating \"Our position is 'no comment.'\"\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage among those who worked on the film, with many expressing shock and disgust at Sizemore's behavior. Production manager Cassidy Lunnen recalled that the girl was \"so young it was unclear to her and [later] her parents what had actually taken place and if it was intentional or not.\"\n\nSizemore has a history of alleged aggressive behavior toward women, including convictions for battery and a recent plea deal for domestic abuse. He has also struggled with a long-standing addiction to drugs.\n\nThe film's producers, including Jai Stefan and Michael Manshel, have spoken out about the incident, stating that they removed Sizemore from the set as soon as they heard about the allegation and encouraged the girl's parents to contact law enforcement.\n\nSizemore's career has continued to thrive despite the allegations, with recent roles on TV shows such as Shooter and Twin Peaks. However, the latest accusations have sparked a renewed wave of criticism and outrage against the actor.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the handling of allegations of abuse in the entertainment industry, particularly in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. As one of the film's producers noted, \"We took the allegation extremely seriously and we were willing to do anything, including dismissing Tom. We just couldn't be police, judge and jury.\"\n\nThe case serves as a reminder of the importance of taking allegations of abuse seriously and holding perpetrators accountable for their actions.",

They say the day after a Born Killers scene in which the girl sat on Sizemore's lap, she told her parents that he had touched her inappropriately, possibly putting his finger inside her. \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited. I was watching her,\" co-star Robyn Adamson says. \"Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was.\" \"There was never any doubt.

Crew members say the girl's parents spoke to police, but ended up not pressing charges, possibly out of fear of ruining her film career. She is now 26 and says she is considering legal action against both Sizemore and her parents. Sizemore, 55, was dropped by his management firm soon after the incident.

Cruz Riojas, now 45, was once a troubled student who frequently exhibited violent outbursts and was classified as a special education student. However, with the help of his teacher, Linda Hooper, Cruz's life took a dramatic turn.\n\nIn 1980, Hooper, a veteran elementary teacher, was warned about Cruz's reputation as a \"holy terror.\" Despite her initial reservations, Hooper took Cruz under her wing and began to see beyond his troubled behavior. She discovered that Cruz was living in a one-room lean-to with his mother, stepfather, and five half-siblings, and was subjected to physical abuse.\n\nHooper's kindness and dedication eventually won Cruz over, and he began to open up to her. She started having him help with small tasks around the classroom and eventually at her home, where he would earn money for his efforts. Cruz's relationship with Hooper's husband, Gale, a firefighter, was particularly significant, as he had never had a positive male role model in his life.\n\nIn 1982, Cruz's stepfather beat him, and his mother asked Hooper to keep him until things calmed down. However, Cruz never left Hooper's home, and he eventually became a part of the family. Hooper and Gale provided Cruz with a stable and loving environment, and he began to thrive.\n\nThanks to Hooper's support and encouragement, Cruz moved out of the special education program and graduated with his peers. He went on to study at Texas Tech University and later met his future wife, Anel Montemayor. Just before his 30th birthday, Cruz asked Hooper and Gale to officially adopt him, which they happily agreed to.\n\nIn 1998, Cruz and Anel were formally adopted by Hooper and Gale, and they became Cruz Riojas Hooper and Anel Montemayor-Hooper. Today, they live in San Antonio with their two children, Hannah and Greyson. Cruz is proud to teach his children about their Mexican roots and the traditions of the Hooper family.\n\nHooper's selfless act of love and adoption has had a profound impact on Cruz's life, and he credits her with teaching him the importance of perseverance and never giving up.

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated. More than a decade later, he was still part of the Hooper family—but he wanted to make it official by asking the Hoopers to adopt him right before his 30th birthday. “He said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor,\" Hooper tells Today. \"I’ve always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us.” The adoption went through in 1998, but Cruz \"was my son from the day I kept him,” Hooper says.

The procedure, which involved creating a pair of ears from Kieran's own ribs, has given the boy a new sense of confidence and self-esteem.\n\nKieran, from Hertfordshire, was born deaf and had small lobes where his ears should be. However, thanks to previous surgery and a hearing aid, he can already hear. The surgery, led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The new ears were then grafted onto Kieran's head, with the help of a vacuum to shape the skin to the contours of the new ear.\n\nThe surgery, which took six hours to complete, has brought significant psychological benefits to Kieran. His father, David Sorkin, said that the boy's confidence has improved exponentially, and his performance at school has also improved. Bulstrode added that if you can change a young person's confidence, you can alter their whole trajectory in life.\n\nKieran's mother, Louise Sorkin, said that she wants her son to be accepted like everyone else, and that the surgery has given him a new sense of identity. Kieran himself said that he wants to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones like his friends, and that he's delighted with the result.\n\nThe surgery is not only a cosmetic procedure, but also a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia. Great Ormond Street Hospital performs about 40 of these operations each year, although most are to create one missing ear.\n\nAdvances in tissue engineering mean that this kind of reconstructive surgery could be done quite differently within a decade. Scientists at the Institute of Child Health, part of University College London, are creating stem cells from patients' fat tissue, which could be used to create new ears. However, this research is still in its early stages, and for the foreseeable future, children needing new ears will benefit from the same procedure used at Great Ormond Street Hospital.\n\nKieran will need a second operation in six months to make his ears stand out from the scalp more, but he's already delighted with the result. His father said that they couldn't have wished for a better result, and that Kieran's reaction was just a \"wow",
            "ground_truth": "An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

Obama had cautioned against \"the urge to turn inward\" and stressed a need to \"resist the urge to demonize those who are different\" in a speech marking the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago. Trump also expressed his displeasure with the Obama administration's steps in its final weeks related to Israel, including a speech by Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Middle East policy.\n\nHowever, in a surprising turn of events, Trump later said that he had a \"nice conversation\" with Obama on the same day, following a phone call from the outgoing president. Trump emphasized that they had a \"general conversation\" and that he thought they covered a lot of good territory. This development came after Obama claimed in an interview that he could have won the 2016 election if he had faced off against Trump, prompting Trump to respond with a series of tweets.\n\nThe transition of power has been marked by controversy, with Trump's team expressing frustration with the Obama administration's refusal to comply with some of their requests. The White House had defended a decision by the Energy Department not to provide names of employees who worked on the Obama administration's climate policy efforts to the Trump transition team.\n\nDespite the tensions, Obama has repeatedly committed to a peaceful and smooth transition of power, keeping with centuries of American tradition. He has said that he will escort Trump to the Capitol and attend his inauguration on January 20.\n\n**Key Developments:**\n\n* Trump accuses Obama of putting \"roadblocks\" in his way, contradicting his earlier praise for the outgoing president's efforts to ensure a smooth transition.\n* Trump expresses his displeasure with the Obama administration's steps in its final weeks related to Israel.\n* Obama claims that he could have won the 2016 election if he had faced off against Trump.\n* Trump responds with a series of tweets, saying that he thinks the transition is not going smoothly.\n* Trump later says that he had a \"nice conversation\" with Obama, following",

Many saw comments made by Obama during Tuesday's Pearl Harbor anniversary as directed at Trump. The president urged the US not to \"turn inward\" and to \"resist the urge to demonize those who are different.\" Trump is also upset with the Obama administration for allowing the UN to pass a resolution condemning Israeli settlements, as well as with Obama personally for saying in an interview he could have beaten Trump and won a third term. In addition, the White House is defending the Department of Energy for not complying with a request from Trump's transition team for the names of employees involved in climate policy, ABC News reports. Transition team spokesperson Sean Spicer at first said Trump's tweets \"speak for themselves, very clearly,\" but later complimented members of the Obama administration for being \"helpful and generous with their time.\"",

The incident occurred in March 2014 when the panda, which was being chased by other villagers, bit Guan's leg, requiring eight surgeries and potentially leaving him with a permanent injury that may require amputation.\n\nGuan's son sued local forestry officials and the nearby Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to over 100 wild pandas. Following negotiations, officials agreed to pay the compensation of 520,000 yuan ($83,000), which will cover Guan's medical bills.\n\nThe incident highlights the dangers of wild pandas, which are often perceived as harmless due to their lovable appearance. However, they are members of the bear family and have a fearsome bite, capable of inflicting serious injuries.\n\nDespite the risks, wild pandas are a major tourist attraction in China, generating significant revenue for the country. Conservation efforts have also been successful, with the number of wild giant pandas increasing by nearly 17% over the decade to 2013 to reach 1,864, according to state media.\n\nThe giant panda's natural habitat lies in mountainous southwestern China, where they are under pressure from factors such as habitat loss. Conservation measures have been credited with the increase in their population, and efforts continue to protect these endangered animals.\n\nThe incident also serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting wildlife and their habitats. As the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) notes, \"As cuddly as they may look, a panda can protect itself as well as most other bears,\" using its heavy weight, strong jaw muscles, and large molar teeth.\n\nIn conclusion, the compensation awarded to Guan Quanzhi is a significant step towards acknowledging the risks associated with wild pandas and the importance of protecting these endangered animals and their habitats.",

A man in China recently received a harsh reminder of that after a wild panda bit his leg after authorities pursued the critter onto his lawn, reports AFP via Yahoo. The creature had made its way into a northwestern village, which is near a sanctuary that's home to about 100 wild pandas. \"I saw a panda jump out in front of me, its body completely covered in mud,\" the man told local news. A struggle ensued, in which the bear wouldn't release the man's leg until a rescuer wrapped a coat around the animal's head. Finally, it fled—but not before causing injuries which, China Daily reports, led to eight surgeries over the past year and may lead to amputation. The man sued three government departments and won an $83,000 payout that will cover his medical costs, his lawyer says. (China Daily has a pretty gruesome photo of the injury.) \"As cuddly as they may look, a panda can protect itself as well as most other bears,\" the World Wildlife Fund notes, per AFP.

Carlie's mother Shannon Trent tells People she felt \"sick to my stomach\" when she heard about those purchases. \"I don't know what he's done to her,\" she says. \"I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.\" Authorities believe Carlie is in \"imminent danger.\" Simpson also purchased camping supplies and nonperishable groceries, and authorities think he may be hiding with Carlie in an isolated area. The TBI says there have been rumors online that Simpson is trying to protect Carlie, but it says that couldn't be further from the truth. \"This was not an innocent camping trip, this was a crime,\" a spokesperson tells WATE. Simpson, Carlie's uncle by marriage, and his wife once had custody of Carlie, but her father James Trent had custody at the time of her abduction. Shannon Trent, who hasn't had custody of Carlie in two years, says she \"always had a bad feeling\" about Simpson. \"I should have stuck with my gut,\" she tells People.

He led the country to a swift and decisive victory in the first Persian Gulf War and played a crucial role in the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union and unification of Germany. Bush's presidency was marked by a painful recession, which cost him a second term in office.\n\nBorn on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, Bush was the son of Prescott Bush, a successful Wall Street executive and U.S. senator from Connecticut. He joined the Navy at the age of 18 and became its youngest pilot, flying 58 missions in the Pacific during World War II. After the war, he married Barbara Pierce and began his business career in the oil industry, eventually co-founding Zapata Petroleum.\n\nBush's entry into politics began with his appointment as ambassador to the United Nations by President Richard Nixon. He later served as chairman of the Republican National Committee, envoy to China, and director of the CIA. In 1980, he ran for president but lost the nomination to Ronald Reagan. However, Reagan chose Bush as his running mate, and they won the election in 1988.\n\nAs president, Bush faced a series of challenges, including a recession and a primary challenge from Pat Buchanan. He abandoned his \"no new taxes\" pledge and signed a tax-raising measure, which led to a decline in his popularity. Despite this, Bush's approval rating approached 90% after the successful conclusion of the Persian Gulf War.\n\nBush's foreign policy achievements were significant, including the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation and the collapse of the Soviet Union. He also played a key role in the reunification of Germany and the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn retirement, Bush remained active in public life, undertaking diplomatic missions and celebrating his birthday with a parachute jump. He developed friendships with former foes, including Bob Dole and Bill Clinton, and worked with Clinton on various projects, including tsunami and hurricane relief.\n\nThroughout his life, Bush was known for his loyalty, integrity, and commitment to public service. He inspired generations of Americans to follow in his footsteps and leave a lasting legacy as one of the most respected and admired presidents in U.S. history.\n\n**Key Quotes**\n\n* \"Read my lips: No new taxes\" (1988)\n* \"We know what works: Freedom works.

He once got shot down, with this video capturing the rescue. Bush is also the only American besides John Adams to be both president and the father of a president.

Simpson has been serving a nine- to 33-year sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping charges stemming from a 2007 incident in Las Vegas.\n\nSimpson's parole hearing comes nearly nine years after he was convicted of the crimes. He has been a model prisoner, according to his lawyer, and has expressed remorse for the incident. Simpson has also spoken to the victims and apologized for the incident, which he said got out of hand.\n\nSimpson's past is marked by controversy, including his acquittal in 1995 of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. He was later found liable for the murders in a civil trial and ordered to pay $25 million in punitive damages to the families of Simpson and Goldman.\n\nDespite his past, Simpson's lawyer believes that he deserves parole. \"He deserves parole. It's as simple as that,\" said Yale Galanter, one of Simpson's defense attorneys. Galanter also believes that the Las Vegas jury that convicted Simpson was motivated by anger over a book that Simpson co-authored called \"If I Did It,\" which was seen as insensitive to the victims and their families.\n\nSimpson's release from prison would be a significant development in his life, and it is likely to be met with a mix of emotions from the public. Some people will be happy to see him released, while others will be opposed to it.\n\nIn preparation for his release, Simpson has been working to improve his behavior and has spoken to the victims and apologized for the incident. He has also expressed a desire to reconnect with his family and friends and to live a quiet life.\n\nHowever, some experts believe that Simpson's release from prison could be a mistake. \"He just says, 'We'll be together again, my life will go back to normal,'\" said Tom Scotto, a longtime friend of Simpson's. \"Normal? There's never been such a thing for O.J. Simpson.\"\n\nSimpson's release from prison would also raise questions about his ability to live a normal life.

The new law makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6g) of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record. This change is expected to have a significant impact on the island nation, where marijuana has long been culturally entrenched but illegal.\n\nThe legislation also paves the way for the establishment of a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. This move is seen as an opportunity for Jamaica to become a player in the nascent medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of innovative pot-derived items.\n\nRastafarians, who have long used marijuana as a sacrament, will now be able to use it freely for religious purposes. Tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana abroad will also be able to apply for permits to buy small amounts of Jamaican weed.\n\nNational Security Minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the legislation does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. The security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe move is part of an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and several countries, including Uruguay and Argentina, have decriminalized or legalized marijuana.\n\nJamaica's commerce minister, Anthony Hylton, sees the cannabis industry as having \"great potential\" for the island, which is laboring under its latest loan program with the International Monetary Fund. Local scientists have already developed marijuana-derived products, such as \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients.\n\nThe passage of this legislation is a significant step forward for Jamaica, which has long struggled with the issue of marijuana decriminalization. The law is expected to have a positive impact on the island's economy and society, and it marks a major shift in the country's approach to marijuana.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6g) of marijuana is now a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record.\n* A licensing authority will be established to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n*",

A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement.

The search and rescue efforts have been ongoing for nearly a week, with multiple countries and agencies involved.\n\n**Search Efforts**\n\nIndonesian search teams have found four large parts of the plane on the sea bed, including a 18-meter-long piece that appears to be part of the jet's body. The objects were detected using sonar equipment and were confirmed to be from the missing plane. Divers have not been able to enter the waters due to strong currents and big surf, but officials are hopeful that they will find many of the passengers and crew still strapped in their seats inside the plane.\n\n**Cause of the Crash**\n\nThe cause of the crash remains unexplained, but bad weather appears to have been a factor. A 14-page report by Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency suggests that the plane was trapped in bad weather that would have been difficult to avoid. The report also mentions the possibility of icing on the plane's engines, which could have been caused by the bad weather.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe investigation into the crash is ongoing, with autopsies to be carried out on some of the bodies, including the pilot and co-pilot. Aviation experts say that the more passengers, luggage, and parts of the aircraft that remain intact, the more likely the plane hit the water in one piece, which would indicate problems like a mechanical error or a stall instead of a mid-air breakup.\n\n**AirAsia's Response**\n\nAirAsia has been reviewing the suspension of its flights from Surabaya to Singapore, which was announced by Indonesian authorities due to the airline not having a permit to fly on Sundays. However, Singapore's Civil Aviation Authority has said that from its end, the airline had been approved to fly the route daily.\n\n**Relatives' Reaction**\n\nFamily members of the victims have been waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones.

Fifteen months later, the little girl is still with social service workers, who won't return her to her mother. The case is now \"an international legal row,\" the Telegraph says, and the anonymous woman's lawyers call it \"unprecedented.\" The woman was in Britain in July 2012 for an airline training course, and called police when she suffered the panic attack. They arrived while she was on the phone with her mother, who told police the woman suffered from bipolar disorder and was off her medication, according to a Telegraph columnist. Police took her to a psychiatric facility, and restrained her under the Mental Health Act when she said she wanted to go back to her hotel. She underwent the C-section after having been there five weeks. The case is ongoing; the mother says she has made a full recovery, but a judge nonetheless ruled that her daughter should be put up for adoption. More on the case here and here.",

This ancient legal procedure, enshrined in the US Constitution, ensures that individuals cannot be detained indefinitely without a valid reason. However, recent developments have raised concerns about the erosion of this fundamental right.\n\n**Guantanamo Bay and the Military Commissions Act**\n\nIn 2006, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) revoked the right to habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay and foreign nationals labeled \"enemy combatants.\" This provision applies to US citizens and legal residents, potentially leaving them vulnerable to indefinite detention without due process. The MCA has been criticized for its ill-considered and dangerous provisions, which undermine the rule of law and the principles of justice.\n\n**The Case of Guantanamo Detainees**\n\nThe majority of Guantanamo detainees were sold into captivity by warlords for bounties, with little or no evidence against them. Despite numerous legal victories affirming their right to challenge their detention, the Bush administration has prevented them from receiving a fair hearing in court. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the detainees' cases for the third time, with the hope of upholding habeas corpus and holding the administration accountable.\n\n**Nonhuman Rights Project and the Case of Hercules and Leo**\n\nIn a groundbreaking decision, a New York judge granted a pair of research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, the right to have their day in court through a writ of habeas corpus. This ruling marks the first time an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus in US history, recognizing chimpanzees as legal persons. The Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, hopes to use this victory to sway judges in other jurisdictions and ultimately secure the right to bodily liberty for cognitively complex animals.\n\n**Implications and Future Directions**\n\nThe erosion of habeas corpus threatens not only the rights of Guantanamo detainees but also the fundamental principles of justice and democracy. The case of Hercules and Leo highlights the need to reevaluate our treatment of nonhuman animals and recognize their autonomy and dignity. As the Nonhuman Rights Project continues to push for the rights of animals, it is essential to defend the right to habeas corpus and uphold the rule of law.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHabeas corpus is a vital safeguard against government overreach and abuse of power.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a New York judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, Science magazine reports. NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals. (Click to read about what chimps talk to each other about.)",

The raids, which occurred in August 2011, are believed to be related to the company's alleged trafficking in illegally obtained wood, specifically ebony from Madagascar.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood, despite being aware of the risks involved.\n\nGibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz claims that the company has been unfairly targeted and that the government has not provided clear evidence of wrongdoing. He argues that the company has complied with U.S. and Malagasy law and that the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India.\n\nHowever, the EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the Lacey Act and the government's efforts to enforce it. She argues that the law is necessary to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that responsible sourcing of wood is essential.\n\nThe Gibson raids have sparked concerns among other guitar builders, who fear that the Lacey Act is burdensome and retroactive. Attorney Ronald Bienstock warns that the law may require guitar owners to prove the provenance of wood acquired decades ago, and that owners may be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S.\n\nThe case highlights the complexities of environmental regulation and its impact on industries that rely on natural resources. As the government prepares to charge Gibson, the company's fate remains uncertain, and the music industry waits with bated breath to see how the case will unfold.\n\n**Related News:**\n\n* The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine has been collecting data from Alexa Internet since 1996, providing a valuable resource for researchers and historians.\n* The Lacey Act has been amended to include plants as well as animals, and requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain.\n* The Environmental Investigation Agency has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood, despite being aware of the risks involved.\n* The Gibson raids have sparked concerns among other guitar builders, who fear that the Lacey Act is burdensome and retroactive.\n* The case highlights the complexities of environmental regulation and its impact on industries that rely on natural resources.",

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\"",

The operation has resulted in the deaths of at least 30 Palestinians, including 13 militants and 16 civilians, and three Israeli civilians.\n\n**Israel's Military Campaign**\n\nIsrael's military has been conducting airstrikes and artillery attacks on the Gaza Strip, targeting suspected rocket-launching sites and Hamas personnel. The Israeli military has reported that it has hit over 600 targets in Gaza, including rocket-launching sites, tunnels, and command centers. The military has also mobilized tens of thousands of troops, with convoys of buses and tanks heading towards the Gaza Strip.\n\n**Hamas' Response**\n\nHamas has responded to the Israeli military campaign with a barrage of rocket fire, with over 300 rockets launched at Israel since the conflict began.

Hamas has also claimed responsibility for firing a rocket towards Jerusalem, which landed in the occupied West Bank.\n\n**International Response**\n\nThe international community has been watching the conflict with growing concern. The United States has called on countries with ties to Hamas to urge the group to stop its rocket attacks. The United Nations has also condemned the violence, with the Nonaligned Movement calling for \"decisive action\" by the UN Security Council.

But Hamas said it would keep firing, and one Israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from Gaza during Kandil's visit, CNN reports. A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times.

Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible. That time is far bygone.\" For its part, the Obama administration says it's seeking help from Arab countries in calling on Hamas to relent. \"The onus rests squarely on Hamas ... to stop its rocket attacks,\" says a State Department spokesman.

The raccoon, which was acting aggressively and erratically, bit Borch's thumb and began to scratch her arms and legs. In a desperate bid to defend herself, Borch drowned the raccoon in a puddle of water, holding its head underwater until it stopped struggling.\n\n**Rabies Outbreak in Maine**\n\nAccording to the Maine Center for Disease Control, there have been 20 animals that have tested positive for rabies in 2017, including raccoons, red foxes, and skunks. This is a significant increase from 2016, when 64 animals tested positive for the disease.\n\n**Precautions and Prevention**\n\nMaine animal control officer Heidi Blood warns that if one animal tests positive for rabies, it's \"almost 100 percent\" certain that there are other animals in the area also infected. Blood advises people and their pets to avoid animals that are acting aggressively or erratically, even if they appear to be dead, as the rabies virus can live outside the body for 24 hours.\n\n**Vaccination Requirements**\n\nUnder Maine law, cats and dogs, even if they stay indoors, must be vaccinated against the disease. Blood emphasizes the importance of vaccination and encourages people to take precautions to prevent the spread of rabies.\n\n**Recent Attacks**\n\nIn addition to Borch's attack, a Wiscasset man was bitten on both hands by a suspected rabid fox in Topsham earlier this week. Borch has received six shots, including the rabies vaccine, and is expected to receive her last injection this weekend. She has been taking antibiotics for the puncture wounds on her hands.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe recent surge in rabies cases in Maine serves as a reminder of the importance of taking precautions to prevent the spread of the disease.

NASA scientists have used infrared maps to analyze the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps.\n\nThe ocean, which lasted for millions of years, was at least a mile deep in places and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. The scientists believe that the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, used data from three of the most powerful infrared telescopes in the world to analyze the Martian atmosphere over six years. The researchers found that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past.\n\nThe findings suggest that Mars was habitable in the distant past, with long-standing bodies of water, lakes, deltas, and perhaps even seas. The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil.\n\nAstronomers have also determined that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago. The evidence comes from an analysis of the water vapor that lingers today in the Martian atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor.\n\nThe study suggests that the ancient sea once covered a fifth of the planet's surface, and that the water would have reached a depth of about 450 feet (137 meters) if it had covered the entire planet evenly. However, the true amount of water that pooled on the ancient surface of Mars may have been much larger.\n\nThe findings continue to mount that Mars was once far wetter and warmer than it is today, and that the ancient chemical environment was hospitable to biology. This means that support for the notion that life might once have existed on Mars is only getting stronger.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Mars had a massive ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere four billion years ago.\n* The ocean was at least a mile deep in places and held 20 million cubic kilometers of",

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Jumaah, a member of the Yazidi minority, had been working on his PhD at Lund University in southern Sweden when he received a text message from his wife, warning him of the growing violence in their home country.\n\nJumaah had initially stayed behind to complete his lab work, but when he returned to Iraq for a family wedding, he found himself in the midst of a deadly conflict. His family was facing a life-and-death situation, and Jumaah sent a desperate text message to his supervisor, asking her to remove him from the doctoral program if he wasn't back in Sweden within a week.\n\nProfessor Turner, who was shocked by the message, called Jumaah and discovered the gravity of the situation. She quickly sprang into action, contacting the university's security chief, Per Gustafson, who arranged for a rescue operation. Over a few days, Gustafson hired a security company, which then arranged for a team of heavily-armed mercenaries to extract Jumaah and his family from their hiding place in a disused bleach factory.\n\nThe rescue mission was a success, and Jumaah and his family were safely evacuated to Erbil Airport, where they were reunited with Jumaah's wife and two small children. The family has since settled in Sweden, and Jumaah has completed his PhD and now works for a pharmaceuticals company in Malmö.\n\nThe rescue operation was a unique event, with no other university involved in a similar mission. Gustafson described it as a \"unique event\" and praised Turner's determination and courage in helping to save Jumaah and his family.\n\nTurner's actions were motivated by her concern for her student's safety and her outrage at the actions of ISIS. \"What was happening was completely unacceptable,\" she said. \"I got so angry that IS was pushing itself into our world, exposing my doctoral student and his family to this, and disrupting the research.\"\n\nThe story of Jumaah and his family's rescue is a testament to the power of human kindness and determination in the face of adversity.",

Charlotta Turner called him right away: \"He was very sad and crying,” the 48-year-old prof at Lund University in Sweden tells NBC News. \"I could hear that the situation was hopeless and they had to flee.\" The student, Firas Jumaah, was visiting his native Iraq to help family members during a brutal 2014 ISIS attack targeting Yazidis—a religious minority that includes his family. The terror group had just enslaved and massacred Yazidis by the thousand in nearby Sinjar. Now Jumaah and family were planning to flee to the mountains. \"I had no hope at all,\" says Jumaah, per the Local. \"I was desperate.\" But Turner took action. She spoke to Lund University's then-security chief, who contacted a company that sent mercenaries into northern Iraq. Only days later, four armed mercs on two Landcruisers blazed into the place where Jumaah was hiding, and rushed him to Erbil Airport with his wife and two young kids. \"I have never felt so privileged, so VIP,\" he says. \"But at the same time I felt like a coward as I left my mother and sisters behind me.\" Seeing his colleagues back in Sweden, he was speechless: \"I just cried,\" he says. Yet Jumaah finished his PhD and found work at a Malmo pharmaceuticals company, and his family survived. The bill: roughly 60,000 kroner ($6,613), which his family has nearly finished paying. “If they told me to pay 200,000 kronor, I would,” says Jumaah. (The UN is finding fresh ISIS horrors.)",

The incident occurred on Saturday, hours after Pippa attended a decadent 18th century-themed party thrown by her close friend, the French aristocrat and designer Vicomte Arthur de Soultrait.\n\nAccording to reports, Pippa was in the passenger seat of an Audi convertible with three male friends, including de Soultrait, when the driver allegedly reached for a semi-automatic gun and jokingly aimed it at a paparazzi following them. The image shows Pippa looking back at the paparazzo and grinning as her friend, the driver, reaches down and aims what appears to be the gun.\n\nHowever, it has since been revealed that the gun was a fake, and the photographer who was being targeted has said that he knew all along it was a toy and never felt scared. Despite this, the French authorities are investigating the incident, and all four people in the car could face arrest and imprisonment for up to two years.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread outrage in France, where a recent spate of high-profile shootings has left the country on high alert. Pippa's involvement in the incident has also raised questions about her behavior and judgment, particularly given her high-profile status as a member of the royal family.\n\nThe Palace has refused to comment on the incident, citing that Pippa is a private individual and not a member of the royal family. However, some have suggested that the Palace should take a more active role in protecting Pippa, who is often in the public eye and may be vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nVicomte de Soultrait, who is a close friend of Pippa's and a successful young entrepreneur, has been described as a \"party animal\" who loves decadence and the high life. He has a long-standing friendship with Pippa, who has been a frequent visitor to his Parisian chateau.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the behavior of Pippa's companions, who appear to have found the gun stunt hilarious. Pippa's involvement in the incident has sparked widespread media attention, and it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold.\n\nIn related news, Pippa was seen attending a lavish party in Paris on Friday, where she was surrounded by a \"gaggle of hangers-on\" and posed",

The movie follows the story of Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con man, and his young apprentice, Jess Barrett. The film's plot revolves around their elaborate cons, which take them to various locations, including casinos, racetracks, and football games.\n\nThe movie has received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its charm and wit, while others have criticized its absurdity and lack of emotional depth. Mick LaSalle, a movie critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, wrote that the film is \"ridiculous in every detail\" and that its con is that it's showing a secret underworld, but it's not doing any of those things. However, he also noted that the film has some scattered good moments, including a scene where Will Smith and Margot Robbie are in a VIP box at a football game, making small bets with each other.\n\nThe casting of the movie was a significant challenge, with several actors, including Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck, being considered for the lead role. The female lead was also a subject of much speculation, with actresses such as Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, and Kristen Stewart being rumored for the part. Ultimately, the role went to Margot Robbie, who was chosen for her charm and wit.\n\nWill Smith's performance in the movie has been praised for its charm and charisma. He plays the role of Nicky Spurgeon, a con man who is confident and persuasive. The movie's writers, Ficarra and Requa, have said that they wanted to let Smith be himself in the role, and he has delivered a performance that is reminiscent of his earlier work in movies such as \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and \"Men in Black.\"\n\nThe movie's success can be attributed to its lighthearted and playful tone, which is reminiscent of classic caper films such as \"The Lady Eve\" and \"The Sting.\" The film's R rating allows for some raunchy wit and humor, which adds to its charm. Margot Robbie's performance as Jess Barrett has also been praised for its charm and wit, and she has been compared to a modern-day Grace Kelly.\n\nOverall, \"Focus\" is a movie that is best enjoyed for its lighthearted and playful tone, rather than its complex plot or emotional depth.

Smith \"takes a welcome break from glowering sci-fi roles\" and writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa \"deserve some credit in letting Will be Will in the star's first charm barrage since 2005's Hitch.\" Steven Rea at the Philadelphia Inquirer admits Smith \"shows some of the movie-star wattage that's been missing from his recent pics. He charms.\" There's also \"combustible chemistry\" between Smith and Robbie, but the movie just \"disappoints,\" Rea writes. \"Even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film ... ultimately makes no sense.\" Betsy Sharkey, on the other hand, says this \"rom-com-con\" is \"an irresistible reminder of all the reasons we first fell for the Fresh Prince so many years ago.\" Writing at the Los Angeles Times, she notes the romantic role of Nicky fits Smith perfectly, while Robbie is \"more than holding her own\" as his match. \"The scams are Rubik's Cube complicated, but what keeps you guessing is whether the romantic connection between Jess and Nicky is real or just another con.\" But Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle isn't convinced. In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.\" Nicky and Jess lack \"impact,\" partly because \"Smith is not a strong leading man,\" he says.

The case has been ongoing since 2002, with various appeals and rulings.\n\n**Ruling and Implications**\n\nThe European Court of Justice found that Nestlé had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive. However, the court also dismissed an appeal by Mondelez against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016. The outcome leaves open the possibility that the trademark agency could preserve protection for Kit Kat's shape, but only if new evidence is presented to show that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries.\n\n**National Trademark Status**\n\nWhile the EU trademark is at issue, the shape of the Kit Kat bar is still protected in some countries, including France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. However, in the UK, a court case in 2016 found that Kit Kat had \"no inherent distinctiveness,\" and the trademark was not granted.\n\n**Other Trademark Disputes**\n\nThe case has implications for other trademark disputes, including a dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury over the purple color used to wrap Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolate bars. Additionally, a case involving gold chocolate bunnies, which was lost by Swiss chocolatier Lindt, highlights the complexities of trademark law in the EU.\n\n**Brexit Connection**\n\nThe case has also been linked to the Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat. However, the ruling is not directly related to Brexit, and the case will continue to be decided by the EU's trademark office.",
            "ground_truth": "\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested. (Atari accused Nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for KitKat.)",

Rex: Uncovering the Sounds of Dinosaurs**\n\nFor decades, the Tyrannosaurus Rex has been depicted as a ferocious creature with a thunderous roar, thanks in part to movies like \"Jurassic Park.\" However, new research suggests that the T. Rex and other dinosaurs may not have sounded like that at all. In fact, scientists believe that they may have made sounds more similar to those of birds, with low, throaty whooshes of air.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Evolution, closed-mouth vocalizations, which are sounds made by birds with their beaks closed, may have been a common trait among dinosaurs. This type of vocalization is often used by birds to attract mates or defend their territory, and is characterized by low-frequency sounds that are much quieter than those made with an open beak.\n\nThe study, which analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species, found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The researchers also found that only animals with relatively large body sizes, such as doves and ostriches, use closed-mouth vocalization behavior.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University, said that the association with large bodies is a matter of physics. \"The inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge,\" he explained. \"The lung pressure required to inflate a cavity depends on the tension in the wall of the cavity, and this tension increases for smaller body sizes.\"\n\nThe discovery that dinosaurs may have made closed-mouth vocalizations has significant implications for our understanding of these creatures. \"To make any kind of sense of what nonavian dinosaurs sounded like, we need to understand how living birds vocalize,\" said Julia Clarke, a professor at the Jackson School of Geosciences and co-author of the study.\n\nIn fact, the study's findings suggest that the sounds of dinosaurs may have been much more subdued than we typically imagine. \"Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds,\" Clarke said.\n\nThe study's results also have implications for the field of sound design, which has long relied on creative interpretations of dinosaur sounds. Gary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on the original \"Jurassic Park\" film, has spoken about the challenges of creating realistic dinosaur sounds. \"If people knew where the sounds in Jurassic",
            "ground_truth": "Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The decision comes after a 14-year effort led by Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos, who stated that the name was a \"symbol and a reminder of racism, slavery, and a very, very bloody Civil War.\" The university will repay an 83-year-old donation of $50,000 made by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1933, which was a condition for changing the name.\n\nThe building, which has been a source of debate among students, faculty, and administrators, will now be referred to as Memorial Hall. Zeppos emphasized that the decision is not about erasing history but about teaching it in a more nuanced way. \"We are not saying this is not part of Vanderbilt's history,\" he said. \"I think we teach history by how we talk about these events.\"\n\nThe university's decision follows a series of changes made to address diversity, including the addition of a chief diversity officer to the leadership team. Students and officials at Middle Tennessee State University have also been pushing to remove the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan, from a campus building.\n\nThe move is part of a broader trend across the country, with universities and institutions re-evaluating the implications of their buildings' names. The Southern Baptist Convention has also voted to urge its congregations to stop displaying Confederate flags.\n\n**Background and Context**\n\nThe United Daughters of the Confederacy originally donated $50,000 in 1933 toward the building's construction and naming rights. Vanderbilt previously attempted to rename the building Memorial Hall in 2002, but the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued to keep the original name. A Tennessee appeals court ruled in 2005 that Vanderbilt could remove \"Confederate\" from the inscription only after it had returned the donation at its current value.\n\n**Reaction and Impact**\n\nDoug Jones, the Nashville attorney who represented the Daughters of the Confederacy against Vanderbilt, called the move \"a real slam on the history of our country.\" However, students and officials at Vanderbilt have praised the university leadership for the decision, with Ariana Fowler, president of Vanderbilt Student Government, stating that it demonstrates the administration's attentiveness to student needs and concerns.\n\nThe decision to remove the mention of the Confederacy from the building speaks to the courage of students, faculty",

The group’s $50,000 donation in 1933 helped build the dorm. A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money—$1.2 million in today’s dollars. The university has the cash, thanks to a raft of anonymous contributors who wanted the tie to America’s painful past broken for good. \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos told the Tennessean. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.” Yet tampering with Confederate imagery remains controversial, and a new state law makes it harder to do so, the AP reports.

Nathan Bedford Forrest from a building could face a tougher climb under the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, which now requires a vote of two-thirds of the state’s Historical Commission rather than a simple majority.",

The incident occurred at Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, Florida, where 87-year-old Betty Wagner, who suffers from Alzheimer's, had her engagement ring snatched right off her hand.\n\nAccording to reports, Betty's husband, Arthur Wagner, had purchased the ring for $400 in 1946, and it had been on her finger for 67 years. The ring was a symbol of their enduring love, and its theft was a devastating blow to the couple. When Officer Laurie Graber was called to investigate the theft, she was moved by the couple's story and decided to take matters into her own hands.\n\nOfficer Graber purchased a small heart-shaped diamond ring from JCPenney and returned it to the hospital, leaving it with the nursing staff and a signed note that read, \"It's not much, it's not the same.

The hikers themselves have said that they were simply hiking in the Kurdish mountains and had no idea they were near the border.\n\nSarah Shourd, one of the hikers, has described their ordeal in detail, saying that they were unaware of the border and were greeted warmly by Kurdish soldiers. She has also disputed the US military's conclusion that the hikers were attempting to agitate and create publicity regarding international policies on Iran.\n\nThe delay in the trial of the American hikers is seen as a further complication in the already tense relations between Iran and the US. The US has called for the release of the hikers, while Iran has maintained that they will be tried in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nIn a separate development, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has suggested that the US might release Iranian prisoners in exchange for the release of the American hikers.

We were confused and worried and wanted to go back.\" In Shourd's fullest account of her ordeal to date, she goes into detail about their fateful overnight camping trip, describing \"scores of campfires\" near the waterfall they were hiking to—which abutted Iran. “I think we were extremely unlucky,” says Shourd. “I guess I never believed there would be so many hundreds of people close to a border.” Her interview with the Times comes ahead of a court date for her fellow hikers, which was set for Saturday but has been delayed by Iran until Shourd “can return to Iran or,” if she refuses, her case can “be dealt with differently,” said an Iranian official. But her lawyer says the trial should go forward; neither he nor Shourd, he tells Reuters, were notified of the change.",

The coup is a major setback for one of the region's few established democracies, with the West African regional bloc ECOWAS strongly condemning the actions of the mutineers.\n\nThe soldiers, who staged a mutiny on Wednesday, claim that the government is not giving them enough arms to tackle a rebellion by ethnic Tuaregs in the north of the country. The Tuaregs, a traditionally nomadic people spread across the Sahara Desert, have risen up against the central government in Mali several times since the country's independence from France in 1960.\n\nThe rebellion, which began in mid-January, has been fueled by the return of Tuaregs from Libya who had fought in Gadhafi's army. Refugees have spilled over into four of the countries neighboring Mali due to the uprising. The government has not disclosed how many government soldiers have been killed, but the toll is believed to be significant.\n\nThe mutinous soldiers, who have imposed a nationwide curfew, say they are suspending Mali's constitution and dissolving its institutions. They claim that their objective is not to confiscate power, but to restore democracy and stability to the country. However, their actions have been widely condemned by the international community, with the US and France urging the soldiers and government to resolve their dispute through peaceful means.\n\nPresident Toure's whereabouts are currently unknown, and a loyalist military source close to the president has told AFP that he is well and in a safe location. However, it is unclear whether the mutinous soldiers have complete control of the presidential palace or have the support of all the Malian forces.\n\nThe coup has raised concerns about the stability of the region, with Mali having had democratic rule for the last 20 years. The country was due to hold a presidential election in just under a month, but it is unclear whether the poll will now go ahead.\n\nThe situation in Mali is currently unclear and unfolding quickly, with reports of gunfire and unrest in the capital city of Bamako.

The soldiers said they were suspending the constitution, dissolving its institutions and instituting a nationwide curfew. They said they were taking power because of President Amadou Toumani Toure's failure to defeat a rebellion by the Taureg tribes in the north, the AP reports. The military “has decided to assume its responsibilities and end the incompetent and disavowed regime of Amadou Toumani Toure,” the troops said, adding that it “does not in any way aim to confiscate power, and we solemnly swear to return power to a democratically elected president as soon as national unity and territorial integrity are established.” The mutiny comes just a month before Toure was set to leave office legally.",

Chapman's character, Martyn Lannister, appeared in Season 3 of the show, two years before he took on the role of Tommen.\n\nMartyn Lannister was a young lordling who was taken as a hostage by Robb Stark's army and later murdered by Lord Rickard Karstark in revenge for Jaime Lannister killing his son. Chapman's character was a member of the Lannister family, the son of Kevan Lannister, Tywin's younger brother.\n\nThe revelation has sparked a discussion about the \"Tommen is a faceless man\" theory, which suggests that Tommen's character is a faceless man, a mysterious figure in the show. However, this theory is likely nonsense, and the real significance of the discovery is that Chapman played two roles in the show, both of which are part of the Lannister family.\n\nThe news has also highlighted the show's tendency to recast characters as they grow older, with Chapman's character being recast from the younger actor Callum Wharry. The show's use of recasting has allowed for a more realistic portrayal of the characters' aging process, but it has also led to some interesting coincidences, such as Chapman playing two different members of the Lannister family.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Chapman's dual roles in Game of Thrones has provided a fascinating insight into the show's casting process and the complexities of the Lannister family's storyline.\n\n**Timeline of Events:**\n\n* Season 3: Martyn Lannister appears in two episodes, played by Dean-Charles Chapman.\n* Season 4: Tommen Baratheon takes the throne, played by Dean-Charles Chapman (after being recast from Callum Wharry).\n* Season 6: The \"Tommen is a faceless man\" theory is discussed among fans.\n\n**Key Players:**\n\n* Dean-Charles Chapman: Actor who played both Martyn Lannister and Tommen Baratheon.\n* Callum Wharry: Younger actor who played Tommen Baratheon before being recast by Chapman.\n* Kevan Lannister: Tywin's younger brother and Martyn's father.\n* Lord Rickard Karstark: Northern lord who murdered Martyn and",

But he also played Tommen's cousin, Martyn Lannister, in a few episodes of the show back in the third season, Mashable explains. Hello Giggles thinks the recasting makes complete sense. “Given the Lannister family’s penchant for incest, having several people in that lineage look the same (like exactly the same) would not be a surprise.” Poor Martyn was killed off after being taken hostage by Robb Stark, and Bustle thinks Chapman better hope for a third role as Tommen is \"probably doomed just like his look-alike cousin.\"",

The memo has been a source of escalating partisan tension in Congress, with Republicans arguing that it shows wrongdoing by FBI officials involved in surveillance of a Trump campaign aide, while Democrats say it mischaracterizes intelligence and is an attempt to distract from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe memo has been shared with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but they have expressed concerns about its accuracy and potential impact on national security. Wray has asked to review the memo and has not been satisfied with the response from Republicans.\n\nThe release of the memo has been opposed by the Justice Department, which has warned that releasing it without review could jeopardize national security. However, the White House has stated that President Trump favors \"full transparency\" and has urged the Executive Branch to cooperate with Congress to the fullest extent appropriate.\n\nThe memo accuses senior FBI officials of abusing a classified surveillance program, known as FISA, to spy on a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. It also reveals that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved an application to extend the surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in early 2017.\n\nThe release of the memo has sparked concerns about the potential impact on the Mueller investigation and the FBI's ability to conduct its work without interference.

The Trump administration has announced plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%, a move that has been met with a warning from China that it will retaliate if Washington imposes new trade penalties.\n\nThe escalation of the trade war has led to a decline in global markets, with stocks closing lower in response to the news. However, the prospects of renewed talks between the two sides have lifted industrial shares, with Boeing, Caterpillar, and 3M Co. all adding more than 1% to their stock prices.\n\nDespite the tensions, there are signs that the two sides are trying to restart talks aimed at averting a full-blown trade war. Representatives of US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations.\n\nThe US is seeking certain concessions from China, and if Beijing agrees, it is possible that the US would back off additional tariffs. However, the efforts are complicated by a harder line taken by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has jurisdiction over the US's 301 investigation that sparked the tariffs.\n\nThe two sides have held three rounds of formal talks, but negotiations broke off after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports this month. Beijing responded in kind with its own tariffs, and the dispute has brought the two sides to a stalemate.\n\nThe trade war has also had a significant impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund warning that it may undermine the strongest economic upswing in years. The US and China have struggled to find a starting place for a new round of talks, and the situation remains uncertain.\n\nIn a sign of the trade standoff's impact on Chinese politics, the Politburo has signaled that policy makers will focus more on supporting economic growth amid risks from a campaign to reduce debt and the dispute with Trump. The communique, which followed a meeting of the country's 25 most senior leaders led by Xi, said the nation's campaign to reduce leverage will continue at a measured pace while improving economic policies to make them more forward-looking, flexible, and effective in the second half of 2018.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, and it is unclear whether the two sides will be able to reach a deal.

Bloomberg cites sources who say the White House is thinking about upping the ante and imposing not an additional 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods but an additional 25%. CNN echoes that news via its source. Bloomberg frames the move, which would be revealed in the next couple of weeks, as intended to \"force officials back to the negotiating table through threats of even higher tariffs\"; the last high-level negotiations took place nearly two months ago.

The algorithm was then used to reconstruct a continuous, if abstract, version of the actual videos. This achievement marks a significant step towards decoding dynamic visual experiences, a feat previously only possible with static images.\n\nThe second study, led by Jack Gallant, took this technology a step further by reconstructing YouTube videos from viewers' brain activity. The team used functional MRI to measure subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain, which predicted what was on the screen at the time.

The sequester, set to take effect on March 1, will result in significant cuts to various government programs, including NASA, border security, and public housing support.\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives has been in session for only 20 days this year, with many of those days consisting of pro-forma sessions without votes or ceremonial bills.

The leak occurred after the hacker claimed that Netflix failed to respond to their extortion demands, which included an unspecified sum of money.\n\nAccording to reports, the hacker obtained the episodes in an attack on post-production studio Larson Studios in late 2016, which also compromised unreleased shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic, and IFC. The hacker has claimed to have made an extortion demand to Netflix, but the motive behind the leak may be more about bragging rights in the cybercrime underworld.\n\nNetflix has set June 9 as the official release date for season 5, but it's possible that the streamer may move up the premiere date due to the leak. The company has not commented on the situation, but a statement from Netflix said that a production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised, and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.\n\nThe leak could have a significant impact on Netflix's subscriber growth and stock price, as the company is counting on \"Orange\" to add 3.2 million subscribers from April through June. The hacker has also threatened to release episodes from other networks, including ABC, Fox, National Geographic, and IFC, unless \"modest\" ransoms are paid.\n\nThis is not the first time that \"thedarkoverlord\" has been involved in a high-profile hack. In February, the hacker claimed to have stolen unreleased movies and TV episodes, but later backed down and said that the purloined video wouldn't be made publicly available. It's unclear what triggered the hacker's renewed ransom demands.\n\nThe FBI and other authorities are investigating the breach, and Netflix is working to contain the situation. The leak of \"Orange Is the New Black\" season 5 episodes is a significant blow to the company, and it remains to be seen how it will affect their subscriber growth and stock price.",

Variety reports the hacker was demanding an unspecified ransom from Netflix, uploading the first episode of the upcoming fifth season to a file-sharing site Friday as proof. The next nine episodes were uploaded early Saturday morning after The Dark Overlord claims Netflix refused to pay them. The hacker says they're \"quite ashamed to breathe the same air\" as Netflix, as they were being entirely \"reasonable and merciful\" with their ransom offer. Neither Variety nor the AP have been able to—legally—confirm the authenticity of the episodes uploaded by The Dark Overlord. The new Orange Is the New Black episodes were apparently stolen months ago. Netflix says a production vendor \"had its security compromised\"; Variety identifies that vendor as Larson Studios, a post-production facility. The Dark Overlord says they weren't able to steal the final three episodes of the season because they weren't finished yet. The Dark Overlord told the AP in February they wouldn't release any of the stolen episodes; it's unclear why that changed. The hacker also claims to have stolen TV series from ABC, National Geographic, Fox, and IFC via the hack at Larson Studios. They're reportedly seeking a \"modest\" ransom for those as well.

Despite extensive searches, the location of the plane and the cause of its disappearance remain unknown. However, statistical tools, particularly Bayesian statistics, can help refine and focus the hunt for the plane and provide a solution to the deepening mystery.\n\n**Bayesian Statistics: A Powerful Tool**\n\nBayesian statistics, named after 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical approach that allows for the assessment of various scenarios at once, even contradictory ones. This type of thinking enables the combination of different pieces of information to give the most likely solution. Bayesian statistics have been used in various search operations, including the hunt for U-boats in World War II, a U.S. submarine in the 1960s, and an Air France jet in 2011.\n\n**The Air France Flight 447 Case Study**\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 went missing while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Despite finding debris from the plane, the search for the wreckage was challenging due to unpredictable ocean currents. A team of statisticians from Metron Inc, led by Colleen Keller, was called in to help. Using Bayesian statistics, they assessed the uncertainties of each piece of data and created a probability map to guide the search. Although their initial attempt was unsuccessful, they revised their model and found the plane in 2011, solving the mystery of the crash.\n\n**The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Search**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been ongoing for years, with various teams and governments involved. However, the use of Bayesian statistics in the search has been limited. Colleen Keller, who worked on the Air France case, expressed skepticism about the search, stating that it's likely that the plane is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and may never be found. Despite this, some experts believe that Bayesian statistics can still be useful in the search, particularly in updating the probability map as new information becomes available.\n\n**Challenges and Limitations**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is a complex and challenging task, with many uncertainties and variables involved. The use of Bayesian statistics can help refine the search, but it's not a guarantee of success. The search area is vast, and the plane may have been destroyed or dispersed, making it difficult to find. Additionally, the search team may not have access",
            "ground_truth": "Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found. Bayesian techniques have helped people find World War II U-boats, men overboard, and sunken treasure, but there's no evidence that Malaysia is employing them now. \"I suspect that they just guess, like professional baseball managers used to do before Moneyball,\" says a biostatistician.",

The blasts were followed by heavy gunfire that stretched on for hours, with witnesses reporting panicked soldiers shooting randomly in the air.\n\nThe attacks, which were the latest in a series of bombings targeting security sites and symbols of regime power, resulted in the death of Maya Nasser, a 33-year-old Iranian correspondent for Press TV. Nasser was shot and killed by a sniper while reporting on air, and the network's Damascus Bureau Chief, Hosein Mortada, was injured in the attack.\n\nThe Syrian government has blamed \"terrorists\" for the blasts, while the rebels have vowed to continue their fight against President Bashar Assad's regime. The conflict, which began in March 2011, has killed nearly 30,000 people, according to activists, and has become a regional calamity with global ramifications.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has demanded international action to stop the war, but a resolution is unlikely in the near future due to the veto power of Russia and China.

U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt approved a plea agreement calling for an 85-month prison stint, followed by three years of supervised release.\n\nAs part of the deal, Durst will be transferred to a low-security federal prison facility in California, where he faces a murder charge in connection with the death of his friend Susan Berman in 2000.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael McMahon said it's likely that Durst will leave for California within a few weeks, assuming the federal Bureau of Prisons accepts the judge's recommendation.\n\nThe gun charge stemmed from a search of Durst's hotel room in New Orleans, which turned up a loaded Smith and Wesson.38-caliber revolver, marijuana, and $100,000 in cash.

In public, officials blamed the attack on an anti-Muslim video, while in private, they acknowledged that it was a terrorist attack with no connection to the video.\n\n**State Department Officials' Concerns**\n\nAccording to the report, State Department officials were concerned about the potential impact of military uniforms on diplomacy in the region. During an emergency conference call, officials discussed whether Marines should wear civilian clothing instead of their uniforms, citing concerns that the uniforms could \"hurt diplomacy.\"\n\n**Clinton's Role in Blaming the Video**\n\nThe report accuses Clinton of falsely blaming the violence on an anti-Muslim video, which was used to justify the attack in other countries.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board.",

The handler was testifying during a pretrial hearing where lawyers for Matthew, who is already serving three life terms in prison for a 2005 sexual assault, unsuccessfully challenged the search warrants police obtained for Matthew's home and vehicle, the AP reports. He said the 7-year-old dog, Shaker, traced Graham's scent from downtown Charlottesville to a mulch pile at an industrial site, where the smell of fear was strongest. Matthew, 33, faces a capital murder charge in the 2014 death of Graham, whose body was found on an abandoned property around six weeks after she disappeared. He has also been charged with the 2009 murder of a Virginia Tech student. At Monday's hearing, another police witness testified that, contrary to what the defense claimed, the scent trail was consistent with surveillance videos that showed Graham wandering around, reports WSET. The officer shared text message records indicating that she was lost the night she disappeared.The Washington Post notes that Matthew is seen walking alongside Graham in some of the surveillance videos.",

Egeland, who was already serving a 10-year federal prison term for his involvement in a mortgage fraud case, orchestrated the scam to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a disability insurance policy.\n\nIn 2014, Egeland directed his 17-year-old son, Rylan, to shoot him in the leg with a shotgun along a roadside in Caldwell, Idaho. The shooting was staged as a way to claim disability benefits, and Egeland had applied for the policy just seven days earlier, falsely claiming he had never been arrested or indicted for a felony or misdemeanor in the past 10 years.\n\nThe scam backfired, and Egeland's left leg was amputated as a result of the gunshot. He has since been taking three mental health-related medications and has expressed remorse for his actions, stating that the pain is on his son and that he wishes he could take it all back.\n\nProsecutors described Egeland as a \"menace to society\" and a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist\" motivated by greed. They also noted that Egeland's actions caused \"unimaginable\" psychological and emotional destruction to his minor child.\n\nEgeland's defense lawyer argued that he was suffering from a \"perfect storm\" of medical and mental health issues and financial difficulties at the time of the shooting, and that he already faces a lengthy sentence that will be a challenge for him.\n\nThe judge ordered Egeland to pay the $90,011 he owes in child support and urged him to get mental health treatment and counseling while in prison. Egeland will also be required to submit to a new mental health evaluation when he gets out of custody.\n\nThis additional sentence brings Egeland's total jail time to 13 years and 10 months, a result of his guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the insurance scam and interstate failure to pay child support.",

Shannon Egeland, 43, was already facing 10 years for taking part in a vast mortgage-fraud scheme when he had his 17-year-old son shoot him by a road in Caldwell, Idaho, in an attempt to avoid prison. \"The psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable,\" US attorney Scott Bradford wrote in a sentencing memo. Back in 2009, Egeland was co-owner of an Oregon development company that defrauded banks out of $20 million in loans that he and a partner used to fund a lavish lifestyle. Facing prison, Egeland took out disability insurance and had his son aim for his legs. Egeland told police he'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver, but investigators got suspicious when his pricey BMW, his wallet, and his cellphone weren't taken, the Idaho Statesman reports. Then they learned about his recent insurance, and the whole thing unravelled. Now Egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast. Bradford called him a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,\" the Oregonian reports, but Egeland—who is now on three medications for mental health—has cast his own judgment. \"What bothers me the most is my son—the pain is on him,'' he says. \"If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't. That will haunt me the rest of my life.''",

The incident has sparked an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and raised concerns about the safety of Tesla's Autopilot system.\n\nAccording to Tesla, the vehicle was on Autopilot with adaptive cruise control engaged when it crashed into a barrier on the 101 Highway near Mountain View, California. The company stated that the driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive, but the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\n\nThe investigation has revealed that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier designed to reduce impact, had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced. Tesla blamed the severity of the crash on this factor, stating that they have never seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash.\n\nHuang's family has come forward, stating that he had complained to the dealership about the vehicle's Autopilot system veering towards the same barrier on multiple occasions. His brother, Will, said that Walter had taken the car to the dealership seven to 10 times to address the issue, but they were unable to duplicate the problem.\n\nThe California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) has released a statement saying that replacement work was scheduled for the damaged barrier, but storms had delayed the fix. The previous accident that damaged the barrier occurred 11 days before Huang's fatal crash.\n\nTesla has defended its Autopilot system, stating that it \"unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists.\" The company also pointed out that its data shows that Tesla owners have driven the same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged roughly 85,000 times since Autopilot was first rolled out in 2015, with over 200 successful Autopilot trips per day on this exact stretch of road.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles and has come under increased scrutiny following a fatal crash involving an Uber autonomous vehicle in Tempe, Arizona. Arizona's governor suspended Uber's license to test autonomous vehicles on public roads last week.\n\nIn a statement, Tesla expressed its condolences to Huang's family and friends, stating that the company is working closely with investigators to understand what happened and what can be done to prevent similar incidents in the future.",

His early days at the Comedy Store on Sunset Boulevard showcased his unique talent, and his subsequent rise to fame with the hit TV show \"Mork & Mindy\" cemented his status as a household name.\n\nWilliams' filmography is a testament to his versatility and range, with iconic roles in \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Dead Poets Society,\" \"The Fisher King,\" and \"Good Will Hunting,\" for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. However, it was his work in children's films that truly endeared him to a new generation. Movies like \"Aladdin,\" \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" and \"Hook\" showcased his ability to bring joy and wonder to audiences of all ages.\n\nWilliams' impact on popular culture extends beyond his filmography. He was a true original, a master of improvisation, and a brilliant observer of human nature. His stand-up routines were a testament to his boundless creativity and his ability to connect with audiences on a deep level.\n\nAs a person, Williams was known for his generosity, humility, and kindness.

In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan recalls a moment when, facing an onslaught of photographers, Williams asked him—in the voice of a fly from a 1950s sci-fi flick—to \"help me, Ken.

The Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, and will be the first total eclipse of a Blue Moon in nearly 152 years.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\n\nA Blue Moon occurs when there are two full moons in a single month. This happens because the lunar cycle and the calendar year are not perfectly synchronized, resulting in an extra full moon. The January 31 Blue Moon will be the second full moon of the month, making it a rare and special event.\n\n**Supermoon and Lunar Eclipse**\n\nThe January 31 Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse will be a total eclipse, with the moon slowly losing its brightness and taking on a reddish hue due to the Earth's atmosphere bending the light. The eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, and will be the first total eclipse of a Blue Moon in nearly 152 years.\n\n**Viewing the Eclipse**\n\nThe best time to view the eclipse is right after moonrise and before sunrise, when the moon is sitting on the horizon. The moon will appear its biggest and brightest due to a \"moon illusion\" effect. The eclipse will begin at 11:48am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30pm UTC.\n\n**Livestream and Photography**\n\nThe Virtual Telescope project will provide a livestream of the eclipse from Australia, beginning at 11:30am UTC. For photography, NASA recommends using a daylight white balance and adjusting the exposure slider to get the right balance of light. Putting the moon in context of a local landmark can also help create an original shot.\n\n**History and Rarity**\n\nThe last total eclipse of a Blue Moon occurred on March 31, 1866. The next total eclipse of a Blue Moon will occur on December 31, 2028, and January 31, 2037.

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

President Obama praised first responders and others who helped the injured, saying that America's response to evil is \"selflessly, compassionately, unafraid.\"\n\nPope Francis sent a message of condolence to Cardinal Sean O'Malley, archbishop of Boston, and prayed for the dead, the suffering, and those engaged in the continuing work of relief and response.\n\n**Return to Normalcy**\n\nAs the city began to heal, there were small signs of a return to normalcy. Planes, trains, and automobiles were running at or near normal operating schedules, and some runners took recovery runs to work out the kinks.\n\nHowever, the mood remained subdued, and a pall hung over the wood-frame Dorchester home of victim Martin Richard, where neighbors and strangers left flowers and balloons on the front steps.\n\n**Interfaith Service**\n\nPresident Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday for an interfaith service, where he will join with leaders from across the nation to honor the victims and their families.\n\nAs the city of",

She was always smiling. You couldn’t ask for a better daughter. She was the best.” Campbell was a restaurant manager, reports the Boston Herald, which notes an especially wrenching detail: Her father was initially told she was alive, but when he got to the ICU, he realized it was his daughter's friend who had survived. Campbell is the second of the three people killed to be identified. The first was 8-year-old Martin Richard, and his father, Bill, released a statement today thanking supporters and asking for privacy, reports WBZ. \"My dear son Martin has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Boston. My wife and daughter are both recovering from serious injuries. We thank our family and friends, those we know and those we have never met, for their thoughts and prayers. I ask that you continue to pray for my family as we remember Martin. We also ask for your patience and for privacy as we work to simultaneously grieve and recover. Thank you.\" The third victim was a grad student at Boston University, but the person's identity is being withheld until the family says it's OK to release, reports USA Today.",

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, analyzed data from 188 countries from 1980 to 2013 and found that obesity rates are rising in both rich and poor nations.\n\n**The United States: A Leader in Obesity**\n\nThe United States leads the world in obesity, with 13% of the global obese population, despite having only 5% of the world's population. The country has seen a significant increase in obesity rates, with about one-third of adults being overweight and another third being obese.\n\n**Global Obesity Rates**\n\nThe study found that obesity rates are highest in the Middle East and North Africa, with over 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women being overweight or obese. Other countries with high obesity rates include:\n\n* Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait, where more than 50% of adults are overweight or obese\n* New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, where men have high obesity rates\n* Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, where women have high obesity rates\n\n**Children and Adolescents**\n\nObesity is also a growing concern among children and adolescents, with rates rising nearly 50% worldwide. In developed countries, men have higher obesity rates, while in developing countries, women have higher rates.\n\n**Causes of Obesity**\n\nThe study suggests that the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles are major contributors to the global obesity epidemic. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions.\n\n**Consequences of Obesity**\n\nObesity is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers. Chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually, according to the U.N. World Health Organization.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe global obesity epidemic is a growing concern that requires immediate attention. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of obesity, including the availability of unhealthy food and sedentary lifestyles. By working together, we can reduce the burden of obesity and promote healthier lifestyles worldwide.",
            "ground_truth": "There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns. The 188-country study found that there are 2.1 billion overweight or obese people in the world, making up around 30% of the world's population, up from 20% in 1980, USA Today reports. Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike.",

According to reports, Tom Cruise has written an emotional letter to Katie Holmes, attempting to rekindle their friendship, if not more. The letter, which was written after 12 months of separation, is said to have been a shock to Katie, but she has reportedly been \"genuinely touched\" by Tom's words. The couple divorced in July last year after Katie filed for divorce, citing reasons that Tom ignored the signs of their troubled marriage. Despite the letter, sources close to Katie say she is not interested in reuniting with Tom and is instead focusing on building a new life for herself in New York City with their daughter Suri.\n\n**Fashion and Lifestyle**\n\nIn other news, this week's LOOK magazine is now on sale, featuring the latest fashion trends and must-have buys. The magazine also includes an exclusive interview with Kristen Wiig, who apologizes for her wild past. Additionally, the world's top make-up artist reveals A-listers' secrets, and there's a warning from a royal bodyguard that Kate Middleton's baby is in danger.\n\n**Technology**\n\nIn a separate development, Alexa Internet has been donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996. The data, which flows in every day, is added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. This initiative has been instrumental in preserving the internet's history and making it accessible to the public.\n\n**Cybersecurity**\n\nThere's also a warning about cyber spies, who are allegedly watching people through their computers.

Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one. (Just to keep things in perspective, we'll point out that Look is the sort of magazine that also runs headlines like, \"Royal Bodyguard Warns: 'Kate Middleton's Baby Is In Danger!'\") In other news, Huffington Post notes that it's Cruise's 51st birthday.",

The couple, both 75 and 70 years old, were discovered hanging from a railing surrounding their basement lap pool.\n\nAccording to Toronto police, the cause of death was ligature neck compression, meaning strangulation. The homicide squad is now leading the investigation, although police initially classified the deaths as \"suspicious\" rather than a homicide.\n\nThe couple's family has dismissed the theory that the deaths were a murder-suicide, calling it \"inconsistent with the rumours regrettably circulated in the media.\" Friends and colleagues of the Shermans have also expressed shock and disbelief at the suggestion.\n\nBarry Sherman was a renowned businessman and philanthropist, with a net worth estimated at $4.77 billion, making him the 15th-richest person in Canada. He founded Apotex, a generic pharmaceuticals giant, and was known for his dedication to his work. His wife, Honey, was a dedicated philanthropist and member of several boards, including the Baycrest Foundation and the York University Foundation.\n\nThe couple's friends and colleagues have described them as kind and generous, and have expressed their shock and sadness at their deaths. Toronto Mayor John Tory and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have also paid tribute to the couple.\n\nAs the investigation continues, police have not found any signs of forced entry or suspects-at-large. The couple's real estate agent discovered their bodies, and there was no note left behind to explain what had happened.\n\nThe community is still reeling from the news, with a makeshift memorial set up in front of the couple's home.

The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

The final round of voting took place on January 3, 2012, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains and potentially win a majority of seats in the new parliament.\n\nThe Brotherhood's party has been leading in the polls, with estimates suggesting it has won nearly 50% of the seats allocated in the first two rounds of voting. The party's leader, Essam el-Erian, has downplayed the possibility of winning a majority, but analysts believe it is a strong possibility. The Brotherhood has stated its intention to form a coalition government, but winning a clear majority would enable it to govern without forming an alliance.\n\nThe elections have been marked by controversy, with the military rulers facing growing opposition from protesters who demand an earlier end to military rule. The ruling generals have said they will not cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. The new parliament is expected to take authority over the hiring and firing of a prime minister, but the military rulers have said they intend to retain control.\n\nMeanwhile, Hosni Mubarak's trial has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing the ousted leader of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters in the crackdown on a popular uprising that forced him out of office. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, face corruption charges in the same case.\n\nThe prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, delivered a scathing critique of Mubarak's rule, branding the 83-year-old a corrupt man whose lust for power will forever tarnish his legacy. Suleiman accused Mubarak of engineering the most fraudulent parliamentary election seen in Egypt since the army seized power in a 1952 coup. Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted of complicity in the killing of protesters.\n\nThe trial has been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge be removed. The trial is expected to continue for several days, with the prosecution presenting its case against Mubarak and 10 other defendants.\n\nIn related news, Egypt's economy has been struggling, with economic",

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP.",
