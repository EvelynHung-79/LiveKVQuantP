He outlined the necessary components, including a portable device, energy source (battery), user interface (keypad and buttons), digital signal processing chip, infrared LED source, and switch in the main device to perform particular operations. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating speech recognition, with the goal of making the remote control more user-friendly and universal. Additionally, they considered the idea of gesture recognition, but ultimately decided it was too expensive. The team also discussed the feasibility of automatic on/off control, but decided it was not possible with the current price point.",

Since the Marketing and the user interface designer mentioned speech recognition, the industrial designer also took that into account. All these components would cost 5 Euros or even less than that. As for gesture recognition and automatic power control, the group gave them up due to price issues. At the end of the meeting, the group also talked about how to enable the users to find the controller.",

Provided that they would control the cost within 12.5 euros, they would have to cut off some functions, for example, voice recognition.

Then they had a discussion on the decision made by the education workforce council not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training. After this, there were some questions and answers related to the reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector, equality of opportunity and university mergers. In addition, the parity of esteem between academic and vocational post-16 education and funding allocation were also discussed. Then they talked about the regional skills partnerships and the pay dispute situation. At last, they shared some opinions on 'legalised cheating'.",

The Industrial Designer suggested using a joystick or a scroll wheel for navigation, but the group was concerned about the cost and ease of use. The Project Manager suggested creating two concepts: one with a L_C_D_ screen and one without, and the group decided to use a normal battery and a regular chip for the non-L_C_D_ concept. The final design concept included a hand-shaped remote control with a joystick or scroll wheel, and a L_C_D_ screen on the pistol-shaped design.",
